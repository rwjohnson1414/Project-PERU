 ,Wow what a looney rag that New Zealand paper is.  Re: the original article.
 ,replace shootings with bombings
 ,Yes these are equally stupid headlines.
 ,Waiting for NZ prime minister to be photographed wearing a crucifix and be posted a million times.
 ,Common do you seriously believe any rational Muslim/Christian believes its the entire RACE of a people when a group or single fanatic is at hand... This interpretation is in line with same yellow journalism we get so upset about.&#x200B;Please my friends let us embrace rational and mindful thought and maybe our discourse can evolve from this tribalism nonsense that is drowning us...
 ,Muslims bomb churches and hotels kill 300. Muslims hardest hit.
 ,This is gonna catch sum flak bois
 ,Has anyone tried posting this in one of the super left subs and see what BS excuses they come up with for disagreeing with it?
 ,Clever
 ,You're right that sounds like the Greek gods they would vote democrat. :3
 ,I fucking love Ben Shapiro.
 ,I get the impression the Devil *might* have a political party.
 ,I have a cousin that believes all prisoners should be able to vote because she watched some shitty Netflix show and thinks 99% of prisoners are innocent.
 ,That logic doesn't really apply.. Jesus would want open borders free medical care as well as no firearms being the pacifist he was. In reality he would be a mix of both parties. We have to remember there is no "correct" party. Just different viewpoints.
 ,Also he's not overly fond of islam.
 ,“Abolition of sex”?  I’m pretty sure Republicans aren’t endorsing a sexual free-for-all either.  What does he mean here?And considering the kind of person Jesus was I don’t think he’d belong to a party that endorsed the death penalty or the endless pursuit of wealth either. I’m pretty sure God thinks all our parties could use some adjusting.
 ,Ben Shapiro the hero we don’t deserve but the hero we need.
 ,Pappa Shapiro at it again
 ,Wow I totally missed the "wouldn't" and thought it said "would." Jesus me.
 ,Shots fired
 ,This man speaks straight facts
 ,Ben wins the internet!
 ,I doubt he'd be on the side of people who mutilate little boys either.
 ,[deleted]
 ,But God doesn’t have a partyBecause there isn’t a GodAnd that shouldn’t even be a consideration in the law right or left
 ,Ben Shapiro: <in a million more words per minute with a deviated-whiney-septum 5'7" voice > How DARE you accuse all people of racism because of the actions of a few!Also Ben Shapiro: Everyone is an anti-semite for criticizing the fact that America disfigures its foreign policy on behalf of a bronze age holy book that grants a certain group of people a right to live on the only strip of land in the middle east that doesn't have oil. I listen to every episode of Shapiro. When he is right he is super right and when he is a useless shill I think that everything else he says is suspect. sick of his contradictions.
 ,Verified. HuffPo is sad!

 ,She makes an important distinction here. She says that people who are formerly incarcerated should have the right to vote. She also maintains that people who are currently in prison (the terrorists rapists etc.) should not have that right. &#x200B;So I don't view this as a change of tune but rather her saying that ex-cons should be able to vote but not those still serving their sentences.
 ,She must’ve felt the heat. Or maybe it only took her one day to “have that conversation”.
 ,She went to jump on Bernie's bandwagon and then discovered it didn't poll well.

 ,I don't see how trying to engage in beneficial discussions with the mentally deranged would be fruitful. There may be a few moderates that would listen but then pack mentality just destroyed any hope they would seriously consider any argument from someone on the opposite isle. I've tried that back when I first started reddit and it just made me frustrated and stressed out. I have enough real life problems and don't need to be adding the stress of arguing with online faceless libs.  There are no repercussion for idiots on the web unless they are already well known and even then sometimes they get away with saying whatever they want and you have to look no further than twitter for for proof. It's a well intentioned idea but why stress yourself over the hopeless sheeple?

 ,This is the 43rd issue of my New York Times parody comic at FakeNYTimes.com. Full issue: http://fakenytimes.com/43I don't know why the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris caught fire. Last I heard the closest we have to an official cause is a single statement made by an anonymous French judicial police official who believes that the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit.What I do know is that the media's initial reaction to the fire was very unusual. Rather than holding to a more journalistically responsible position of "We don't yet know" they made generous use of hedge phrases like repeatedly referring to "the hypothesis" that the fire was an accident.More disturbingly in the wake of the Sri Lanka church bombings by radical Islamic terrorists the New York Times seems to be running with the idea that shutting down social media after such tragedies is a good idea.WAS it fair to look closely at radical Islamic terrorism or even simply arson as a cause of the Notre Dame fire? Certainly no more or less than renovations. After all one month ago the Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris was damaged by arson. And this past Easter Sunday *another* similarly-named French church Notre-Dame-de-Grâce also burned and investigators are treating that one as arson. And churches are frequently vandalized in France in a variety of different ways including arson.Control of the cultural narrative is slipping away from mainstream media. And while this can certainly be problematic the difficulties we face from using social media are nothing compared to the damage caused by reliance on mainstream media.

 ,Just go stealth as an Easter Worshiper....
 ,[removed]
 ,Congratulations and welcome citizen!
 ,Bwaaahahahahaha......literally the right way.
 ,Lol she thinks we’ll get mad over something that we’ve been asking for the longest time now. Some of these people are so out of touch it’s sad
 ,Somebody give that woman a cream pie
 ,It always saddens me when I see people say things like that because 9/10 it means they've genuinely never spoken to a conservative or trump supporter and that means either we failed to deliver our message or they failed to listen
 ,I feel like people in other countries just hear the liberal propaganda on social media and think that’s how the US is. I can see how this would happen because most of us (Democrat’s) have jobs and can’t sit on social media all day.
 ,Wait... A Trump supporter is supposed to be mad because this beautiful and determined young lady is a legal citizen through her own hard work and tenacity? Mad? Why?? Guys stop letting the anti-Trump media spoon-feed you the bullshit. Seriously. Don’t be a sheep. Develop your own opinions and don’t judge/generalize so harshly.
 ,Lmao we're happy to see this not pissed! :D
 ,Congratulations you took the legal route
 ,Congratulations 🎉
 ,What is Rt ?
 ,Why does no one seem to understand the difference between legal and illegal immigration??
 ,I mean this is what happens. Honestly she shouldn’t be made fun of. A lot of media demonizes and misconstrues the right’s points under the guise of morality.  Media makes up a narrative and normalizes it. It’s easier for people to believe especially if they never actually interact with right wing views or their only interactions are with people they don’t like that are right wing (ex. Grandparents parents strangers) even for non political reasons.
 ,Like the name
 ,The democratic party's (and by extension the medias) purposeful role in conflating legal immigration with illegal immigration is outrageous and highly irresponsible.They know damn well what the current administrations stance is regarding both. But they're more interested in pushing a narrative that Republicans are anti-immigration as a whole resulting in uninformed people thinking this way. Which is sad because obtaining your citizenship is supposed to be a special proud unifying moment.
 ,Now we're getting somewhere..
 ,Republicans should have voter registration tables outside so that we can sign up new citizens after they are sworn in.
 ,This thread seems pretty celebratory. What do you think of my parents who took 20 or so years to gain citizenship (because of your horrible citizenship process >:() and are devout devout Muslims? How far does the congratulatory tone extend? No shade curiosity.
 ,Whay mad? hmmm 🧐🧐Anyways Congratulations for being a LEGAL American citizen! 😊
 ,If that’s what you (and I personally) want how is your party trying to achieve more legal immigration?
 ,There’s a lot of dumb in today’s political climate
 ,Clearly doesn’t know America’s politics too well
 ,They think supporting Trump is being against all immigration.
 ,I remember when this happened she got so pissed that Republicans we're congratulating her.  She kept replying to stop that she just wanted retweets not people replying.   Was so funny
 ,Great! More diversity! We don’t care if you enter legally we care if you enter *illegally*!
 ,Thank you
 ,I'm more mad about her cream pie.Did she mean *tres leches* pie?
 ,Welcome to America. Now go get an education cuz it seems you’re lacking
 ,This makes me happy!
 ,What a window licker
 ,I never understood why some people think Republicans don't want immigration. They don't realize the difference between legal and illegal
 ,That’s awesome. Every conservative/Republican I know has admiration and pride in immigrants wanting to make America their home.
 ,Congrats! But seriously yes. All thats wanted.
 ,Oh KNoW A leGaL ImmIGrAnT. I Am so Mad RiGht nOw!!!?!. WHy dID thEy NoT ComE IlLEgaLy
 ,Well this just proves that obtaining citizenship is so easy an idiot can do it.

 ,It was well covered
 ,Christians?!! You mean "Easter Worshippers"?!
 ,[removed]
 ,It’s a gun control thing.  New Zealand was a shooting with a ridiculous knee-jerk reaction from the law makers on gun control.  A bombing just illustrates how useless gun control is to actually curb terrorism so not a big story.
 ,[removed]
 ,This is not from Rep. Crenshaw’s Twitter account.Given the ”Easter worshipper” stuff I'm sympathetic to this statement but as others have pointed out it seems like it was actually covered pretty much everywhere. That coupled with the similarities in wording between this and the congressman's reaction to Rep. Omar’s statements about 9/11 seems like this is just more fake news from a fake twitter account.
 ,Easter Worshippers not Christians.
 ,I think a lot of people who are responding are missing the point. Here in Australia we had 24/7 live news on developments of the NZ shooting for about a week I would say. After that there was still numerous news stories about it. It is too early to tell if the same will be done for Sri Lanka as it has only been two days since the attack. So far of course there has been reporting. The problem is that it is nowhere near the amount that NZ got and what i find strange is the lack of mention of Islamic terrorism. They are so quick to call out white supremacist terrorism but never Islamic terrorism. Very interesting.
 ,These Easter worshippers....
 , The bullshit media is bullshit. We know  the narrative import Muslim men into your country to destabilize it. If  you say anything you are a racist.When  something happens to a Muslim like a Mosque shooting pass laws wear  hijabs and generally feel like they are the biggest victims ever. Forget  their transgressions.When they do something wipe that shit off the front page.Someone should count how many times New Zealand made the front page of Reddit and how many times killing Christians did.
 ,I think part of the people complaining about the coverage is that it never said anything about being an attack on Christian's when it's an attack on Muslims it seems to be reported more as a hate crime .I believe Obama and Hillary referred to the Christian's as Easter people.
 ,Easter Worshippers

 ,The headline is a little misleading. They're not being blocked by Twitter but by users using a tool called Repeal Shield:From the article:>  Repeal Shield is a service run by volunteers to improve the  experience of Twitter for pro-choice users. Repeal Shield’s own bio on  the platform describes them as “blocking blatant harmful anti-choice  misinformation so you don’t have to.” Simply put Repeal Shield is a  list of over 8000 Twitter users who troll pro-choice Twitter users along  with bots and fake accounts. \[…\]. When you activate Repeal Shield on  Block Together they will link up your Twitter accounts and block these  users from appearing in your feeds and from being able to engage with  you.*&#x200B;So it's people who are pro-choice blocking pro-lifers using a tool designed for pro-choicers to block pro-lifers.&#x200B;The real controversy if you can call it that is that groups that don't have anything to do with abortion are blocking out people who are pro-life simply because they're pro-life. It's akin to someone from r/twoxchromosomes blocking people who are on /r/Republican because they're on /r/Republican even if they've never gone to /r/twoxchromosomes.

 ,This is probably the most understandable description of trumps foreign policy I have read. It’s not often I see so many philosophers mentioned in a political article either. It gave it some weight but I think it was used a bit heavy handed. While I also agree that his policies do in fact run counter to globalism I think that nationalism isn’t quite the right word to describe it. Trump doesn’t seem like the flag waving in the background patriotic speech type. It’s more like reminding ourselves what the “American dream” mythos was. It’s not helping the world to feel holier than thou it’s hope and knowing that better is always there. I think we got distracted by trying to spread democracy like it was a damn religion and trying to act like missionaries across the world and in the process lost site of what American was and should be.

 ,So I went to read the second article: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/07/08/government-drops-doctor-says-gender-given-birth/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/07/08/government-drops-doctor-says-gender-given-birth/)&#x200B;And the first :  [https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/06/nhs-doctor-decapitated-baby-botched-birth-cleared-return-work-7608758/](https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/06/nhs-doctor-decapitated-baby-botched-birth-cleared-return-work-7608758/) Once you read it you realise these are not the same stories and are not comparable.The latter doesn't work for the NHS anymore anyway and was working for the government the Department for Work an Pensions as a disability assessor. He can still be a doctor. He simply lost his non-NHS job.From the Telegraph article:>Dr David Mackereth has worked for 26 years as an NHS doctor but was told he could not be employed as a [Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) ](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions)disability assessor if he refused to identify patients as being of a sex that they did not see themselves as.One story is a doctor who made a mistake and was allowed to work again. The latter is a doctor who stopped working as a doctor and was working in a quite different role and refused to do something the employer required him to do as an employee because their lawyers told them it was a legal requirement. He was not even sacked/fired he told his employers he couldn't meet the terms of contract as an employee so they didn't proceed with employment.Please don't allow false comparisons like this to colour your views.&#x200B;(This comment was posted on JBP and r\\POLITIC sub by another Redditor for the exact same post (by a different user) but holds true I agree what the doctor did is horrifying she however probably did her best in this unusual situation. Again these two cases are simply not comparable as their contexts are highly different you should read the relevant article. One also needs to accentuate the fact that Dr. Laxman tried to carry out a successful birth but failed due to unusual circumstances the article states that she followed all the expected procedures)

 ,That's just bullshit. I mean ok you can be pro-life pro-choice or whatever but don't bring science into this saying "it have been decided.&#x200B;Science says the potentiel for life is present from day one but no one can clairly specify at witch point the foetus become sentient. This is why it is  *“religious” or “metaphysical” questions that are “not knowable in the traditional sense.”* &#x200B;Worst part is those arguments who are proven bullshit come back again and again as if no one bother to do reserch.

 ,New Hampshire is most certainly not one of the most liberal states. The governor is a Republican trump supporter.  New Hampshire gave the world Kelly Ayotte.  There are a bunch of Birch Society believers there. Heck the Crying Nazi calls NH home.  Purple state  for sure.

 ,This will never reach the masses that is the control they have.
 ,Hear that Democrats? It turns out black people want the same thing as white people jobs to make a living.
 ,All the liberal voting models indicate they think they’ll maintain +99% of the black vote conservatives don’t even get near that range with old white men this simply won’t hold up long term.
 ,It sickens me that Republicans have always been inept at messaging.  The leaders of the party simply don’t know how to communicate in general let alone to share the positive influence and impact of their policies.  Reaching the black community should be a priority.  Republicans should be hammering away with messaging that tells this group exactly how the job market has turned in their favor.   It’s not enough to claim unemployment is down.   Tell them the “why” behind it.   What has affected this?   Trade policies repatriation of American dollars and jobs.   Educate them!!!Hammer this message repeatedly along with other policy points and show and why it benefits them.  Concurrently show them how aDemocrats have produced nothing but a continuation of their pain.   Show them why that happens.   Liberal tax policies in the cities have driven business out of cities.  Look what AOC just did to Amazon!!  Do the same on other issues for the public in general.  Communicate!!!  Teach!!

 ,(1) No shit measles is virtually eradicated in the US that's why they are outbreaks not a disease spreading amongst the population. (2) They're talking about international travelers not immigrants. People from the US who go abroad on vacation or mission trips or whatever come back exposed to measles and infected spreading the illness. This is an anti vaxxer article. Let's get some facts in here. Every disease has a statistical spreading factor R that is if one person is infected how many people they will infect in an unvaccinated population. Measles has a very high R number of 14. Given the efficacy of the vaccine if about 92-94% of the population does not get vaccinated the disease will spread in the population. It will kill immunocompromised old and very young it can cause severe illness and death. It is nothing to be fucked it.
 ,Guys this is an anti-vaxxer article. What are you doing...
 ,yeah and antivaxxers allow it to spread
 ,I think this was posted in the wrong place. Should be in r/stupidlogic
 ,Imagine that...
 ,Like a pestilence?  This article is fully embarrassing.
 ,No shit!!
 ,I have had to ride a ferry to work(construction) for many years. Many other than Americans ride as well. I never ride inside. Always outside as far forward as I can get rain or shine. I'm uninfected. Others aren't.
 ,Matinee that. We should have something like....immigration control!
 ,More DIVERSITY.

 ,Obama definitely dropped the ball.  But our government continues to do so.  This isn't a left/right thing.  Our government across multiple presidencies is not fighting Russia effectively or intelligently.  They have committed a war act against us and we are sitting around fighting each other.
 ,So you mean to tell me that half of CNN/ABC reporters are married into the DNC but you want to say that Russians got on twitter and thus “meddled” with the election?
 ,Also the Obama administration knew they was interference coming from Russia two years before the election and Susan Rice was told to do nothing about it.
 ,[removed]
 ,I dont understand. You have to find the meddling before devoting resources to stopping it right? So say they hired 1 agent to stop the meddling. How would you direct his actions?
 ,And Russia put Trump in there so he could put America First? So he could boost the economy and jobs? Gasp
 ,The links to Trump and the Trump campaign were painted all over the place. If he's going to be found innocent it must be because of a through investigation. How else? If nothing else we know Russia's involvement now. Hopefully we've learned and can stop it next time around.
 ,Damn sorry but r/terriblefacebookmemes
 ,I’ve pointed this out before but it isn’t the whole generation.
 ,Huh... I don't think it applies generally even when talking about liberals. My friends and I have debates all the time. I do not recall someone getting offended at all.I think the way internet work it makes you think the whole generation is getting offended constantly but I do not think it reflects the reality.
 ,It is the extreme few that we ever hear of on the news.   Media is to blame making us think that the views of a minuscule minority somehow mean anything to the rest of us.
 ,Liberals. Give them enough time and they can and will corrupt anything
 ,r/ForwardsfromGrandma
 ,Most people become offended only when told to do so.
 ,Refer to the episode where Kyle went all PC and started Millenials Against Canada...
 ,Excellent excellent question
 ,Why do South Park and Family Guy now constantly critique millennials and academia for political correctness?
 ,Sooooo true.
 ,Damn good question
 ,Honestly though! South Park literally makes episodes about exploiting crack babies and “stupid spoiled whore” but water is racist these days.
 ,This is akin to a facebook post.
 ,Maybe the generation prior should have been more involved not let them waste so much time watching all of that insightful gibberish.
 ,Damn good question. I was raised on it too and I’m not sure where others started getting offended. Maybe it has to do with the internet. I stopped using social media 5 years ago. It was making me crazy. Since then I’ve noticed I’m less stressed out.
 ,They are sheep.
 ,This!
 ,Pretty ridiculous considering most Republicans are still clutching their pearls over the idea of gay marriage and marijuana legalization
 ,This... this is a glorious question.
 ,Yeah I’ve seen this post before and also I’m part of the generation and conservative as well. Most of the people my age are either conservative or don’t care about politics.
 ,This sentence is boomer heroin
 ,I don’t know either!
 ,I believe current outrage culture comes from a lack of identity for millenials. Boomers have Vietnam the civil rights movement and the huge economic prosperity of the 50's and 60's Gen X xan identify with the boom in technology in areas like health military advancement and even video games which set the foundation for the advanced tech we have today millenial are currently lost in their identity in response they create outrage and try to "fight" for equality to form their own identity.
 ,Ah screw you guys - I’m going home !
 ,The same way republicans get upset when you point out trump isn’t pro gun
 ,Look at who the creators are. They all are far left liberals.
 ,Ste they offended though?  Or just acting offended?
 ,I’m from liberal north jersey and in high school. in 6th grade a became conservative and outcasted but know 3 years later I know of 40 other conservatives in my class of 300
 ,Because it was never offensive to them. They were and are all too happy to épater les bourgeoisie but cannot abide one slight.
 ,It’s the millennials that are offended. Not us. You should see our online comedy.  Also Gen z’ers that care and know about politics are largely republican/conservative.We’re nothing like the millennials. The only thing I’d say we are similar to them is that Gen Z’ers born in the early 2000’s I’d say 00-05 or 06 childhoods weren’t filled with iPhones iPads etc.
 ,It’s actually due to lack of bullies. All these years these kids were able to grow up undisturbed and were allowed to be weird. There was a lack of normalcy. It’s not about the “uhhh liberals ruin everything” it’s about that these kids didn’t have anything that limited them from straying from the norm. We sheltered this generation and made it appear as if it was okay to be gay trans and offended when they were referred to not  what they like.
 ,I don't think we need this amendment anymore. It was proposed in order to remove the influence of trusts from the State legislatures appointing the Senators. We don't live in the Progressive Era anymore so I'd say that it should be repealed.
 ,I'm not sure this amendment is needed. We really need to isolate power from the will of the masses now that it's easier than ever to manipulate huge groups of people with propaganda and misinformation. Election of senators via state legislature is probably the way it should be.
 ,Should be repealed to move toward more Constitutional government.
 ,This just leads to the senate being used for sound bites pandering and less power to states
 ,This amendment honestly just makes the executive more powerful as when Congress doesn't do the presidents bidding the president can go over the heads of Congress appeal to the people and either get them replaced with congressmen who agree with the president who scare the current ones from disagreeing with the president. We saw Woodrow Wilson do this time and again especially with the federal reserve
 ,Needs to be repealed.  This was how the states themselves participated in federal government.  Taking that away took much of the states agencies of self-governance away and turned them more into provinces.
 ,>“It is a difficult plan. It is a necessary plan.... Estimates that tell us that we have only 12 years to get it right. Let’s be clear we have until 2030 to change things fundamentally or our lives won’t be the same” de Blasio said at an Earth Day event yesterday.The Left must always use a "crisis" in order to justify this crap.
 ,RIP delis and hotdog carts? That should be interesting.
 ,To clarify:  *city-controlled facilities such as hospitals schools and correctional facilities* &#x200B;Hot dog carts and Papaya King are safe for now.
 ,Big Hot Dog was late with their protection money.
 ,There aren't many things more iconic than getting a hot dog from a hot dog cart in NYC. How fucking stupid.
 ,Headline: "NYC to Ban Hot Dogs and Processed Meats"Body: City government has decided to reduce the amount of processed and red meat it purchases for its own facilities. No effect on anything else.The politics of outrage.Anyway doesn't matter if NYC elected a militant vegan environmentalist. The Nathan's lobby is too strong. No one's taking down the hotdog man (thank God).
 ,I mean they also banned big gulps and made misgendering somebody a punishable offense so this really isn’t that shocking
 ,I thought this was a babylonbee article...
 ,Remember lads all these folks consider themsleves to be "pro-choice" except guns schools freedom of expression and apparently hot-dogs and processed meat...
 ,Imagine running a small business in nyc.....rip
 ,The Left loves using the levers of government to control your behavior when it comes to everything from shopping bags to soda to what kind of toilet you're allowed to install in your home.But then they'll turn around and throw a shit-fit if they aren't allowed to get stoned and abort babies.They'll call YOU the puritan as they continue to demand more and more control over your daily lives.
 ,The purpose of hot dogs is to use everything and not be wasteful.  What a bunch of imbeciles
 ,The Left is insane; it would be like Chicago banning pizza's.
 ,Banning hot dogs? Are the politicians trying to start a riot?
 ,in·san·i·ty/inˈsanədē/*noun** extreme foolishness or irrationality.plural noun: **insanities**"it might be pure insanity to take this loan"*synonyms:*folly foolishness foolhardiness idiocy stupidity imbecility asininity lunacy madness silliness senselessness brainlessness thoughtlessness irrationality illogicality absurdity ludicrousness ridiculousness;
 ,Wait.....   Read the article.  Not seeing any hot dog ban.   It looks like they are reducing meat consumption in all the schools jails and hospitals.   Did I miss something?
 ,Additionally Vermont shut down their nuclear power plant (a source of clean power) and their carbon emissions **increased** as a result as the people turned to cheap coal rather than solar and wind as the Greens predicted.Not everyone can afford such expensive sources of power.
 ,NYC is banning hot dogs? Hahahahahaha
 ,I'm going to start a hotdog wholesale outfit and smuggle the 'dogs into the city for folks.I'm gonna be rich.
 ,This will stop China and India from fucking the planet how? It’s them doing all the damage really...
 ,I would give a reward to someone posting a photo of that petty  tyrant deblasio (Willhelm!) in a steak house on a Monday. I'll bet he he still eats meat on Monday. (I doubt he slums it with a Nathan's or Slim-Jim though.)
 ,Completely misleading headline:"The plan will cut purchases of red meat by 50 percent in its city-controlled facilities such as hospitals schools and correctional facilities."
 ,Imagine this on the meeting agenda. "Hot Dogs hot or not?" Seems like NYC has much more to worry about than hot dogs but hey I guess this is why NY is in the state it is currently in.
 ,Satire is reality now.
 ,Guys people like hot dogs
 ,So now the deadline is 2030? These lines in the sand keep getting crossed and new lines drawn.
 ,If it was really that important to them they would ban them now or like Jan 1 2020.  Not in 11 years.
 ,Jesus fucking Christ. Immature little Hispanic valley girl Alexandria Ocasio Cortez makes the completely unfounded statement we have only 12 years to live and  to save all humanity we must put Nathan's out of business. I hope some that voted for De Blasio lllloooooove hot dogs.
 ,The first thing I did after reading the title was check to make sure the story wasn't from the Babylon Bee or the Onion.Its so hard to tell anymore.
 ,Congratulations to Mayor De Blasio for Solving Climate Change. Let's name another Bridge--after him this time!
 ,Seriously?
 ,Coney Island without hot dogs?
 ,Wait this isn’t the onion
 ,I genuinely thought this was satire
 ,I'll preface this by saying I graduated from college and paid off my student loans. This is a way oversimplification of the problem. The biggest issue is public universities have jacked up tuition astronomically in the last 20 years. Basically since FAFSA started. The greedy university board members want all those sweet government dollars they can get and they've been jacking up tuition ever since. And people who don't have wealthy parents or trustfunds are left with financial options that a lot  aren't fully capable of understanding at 18 yo.
 ,I disagree with this for a few reasons. I do agree there are lots of people who signed up for far more in loans than they ever should have for degrees that are barely worth the paper they are printed on but I worked 2-3 part time jobs at the same time to attend a public university to get a degree in engineering and I still have debt. It is a manageable amount of it but it isnt by any means small either. I do disagree with student loan forgiveness because I knowingly signed up to owe this money and I have every intention of repaying every cent as it has helped me to live a more fulfilling life but to act like you could work part time and then full time all summer and come out debt free even from a state university is just not even remotely accurate.
 ,I pay less then 7k a year for college and I’m doing just fine.Don’t pay 40k a year for a gender studies course and you will be okay
 ,I worked 2 jobs while going to school full time. It was hard. I still had to take student loans. I took them out with the full understanding I had to pay them back. And they are scheduled to be paid off in 24 months. I acquired the debt I have to pay it off. Not a hard concept l. I don’t expect someone to pay it off for absolutely nothing
 ,So maddening. Steven Crowder said it best “they want us to pay for some kid to study underwater basket weaving”. Give me a break. My sister heard Warren say this and thought it was a good idea I looked at her and said “who do you think is going to pay for that?” I pointed at her and then at myself. She was like “oh didn’t think about that”.
 ,Have to side with the left on this one. University isn’t affordable and community colleges are hit or miss depending on your area. “Hard work” in today’s job climate doesn’t get you rent + college degree. It makes us look out of touch and arrogant. I make over $15 an hour and my living expenses do not allow me to pay for $204 a credit hour. (And my state is on the cheap side)I don’t support free education but take the government OUT of backing student loans that will cause prices to plummet + incentivizes students to get real worthwhile degrees.
 ,I worked full time classes in evenings still ended up with a shit ton of debt.  Being a middle class white dude meant no grants or "special" scholarships for me.  Believe me I wish the loans would go away but I'm realistic and know that will never happen nor should it.  Just gotta keep truckin and pay it down.
 ,Do you honestly think it’s still possible to completely pay off your college debts working part time at a minimum wage job?Fuck off boomers
 ,Wut? I worked part time during school and full time during the summer. I also got grade based scholarships and other scholarships that required ~10 hours a week. All that and I still graduated with a ton of debt.
 ,Not really. But the fact is the people who go to school and cant pay for it want the people who didn't go and the people who have paid theirs off to be forced to help them. How is that fair?         Also I want to see how this will work because what about people that keep switching majors and stay indefinitely?
 ,I'm still in debt after being in the guard and working full time while going to school :) I'm glad I have a guaranteed job to pay off those loans when I graduate tho! (This isn't sarcasm. I'm genuinely happy for myself)
 ,I went for 1 year of community college ended up just failing miserable I realized college isn’t for me like the worst way to teach me is to tell me to read a book because that’s the most useless way of learning imo. I ended up taking a 1 year “web design” online course to stay on insurance so I would have something to my name. When it got closer to graduation I felt the weight of not having health insurance adhd medicine is hella expensive and wanting to be able to actually move out in my own as I was getting married in 14 months I applied to any job I could find and ended up working as a termite technician. Long story short: fuck anyone who votes for the candidate that is promising to take my tax dollars to pay for their shitty degree.
 ,Not going to lie I read it as "beer" instead of "bear"
 ,You’re gonna have to do more than that to pay it off BUT I will agree that anyone can get a good paying job after college but they have to actually intern or hold jobs that are good (not getting in a discussion of exploited labor through internship if that’s all you can get then go for it). They can’t just drink and play video games like I saw when I went those are the ones saying their degree is not marketable.
 ,Worked full time went to school full time and had a non-paying internship and still have about 30k in debt...
 ,Fuck I’m trying to go to law school. Rip
 ,You’re not going to pay off 24k in debt working at McDonald’s.
 ,I don't have the option to attend a state university or community college in Oregon that has the kind of clinical I need for my degree. The college I am going to costs about 55k per year. I have received 30k per year in scholarships and my boyfriend received the same amount in scholarships. We are still looking at a lot of debt and that's only for our undergrads. I do not agree with loan forgiveness either her because my schooling was my choice. However I do not party and I  and I have worked very hard nights and weekends and that is not enough to come out debt free and on top for a lot of people.
 ,Universities are so expensive now. It’s not about a person working hard because it’s not comparable to years past. No matter what side of the party line you’re on I think both parties agree there needs to be reform in the college system.
 ,There is no job a high school graduate can work that will pay for college with 3/4 of a years wages. You know this is true you have access to a calculator. Why are you framing it this way?
 ,Part time doing what selling drugs?  Tuition is $15k a year by itself....
 ,We need student loan reform. 1. Student loans are almost impossible to get out of. Even private ones at 14% are nondischargable debt. We need the lenders and the schools to be on the hook for some of this. Schools should be held accountable for their graduates and their income. Lenders should be held to reasonable expectations of loaning and payback based on the states in state tuition at public schools. 2. Public Interest Loan Forgiveness should be done year by year and based off of what you're doing and what it "should" cost. We shouldn't subsidize someone who went to Duke and incurred $200000 in student loan debt for a gender studies degree and works for a non profit. 3. Student loans should be amortized and not allow huge capitalization of interest. 4. More to come...
 ,The thing I don’t get is how they can’t comprehend that the debt on their books is a receivable on someone else’s. So yay you got your debt erased what about the other party that had a receivable for that amount?
 ,I worked nearly full time (35 hours) to pay my way through college and watched all the liberal arts majors drink their brain cells away on daddy’s dime.  I have no sympathy for these lazy morons.  They knew they were assuming debt and did NOTHING about it.  We can’t reward bad behavior.
 ,I disagree with this. I attend a private University which costs around 40k per year (erau). I don't feel that it is reasonable to assume that I could pay for that with a part-time job during the school year and a full time job during the summer. I worked a full time job year round and I am leaving school with massive debt.
 ,You think working part time and full time in summers is enough to pay for college? What kind of job are you working?
 ,I worked three jobs and went to school. Still had to take on student loans. Thankfully just $5000. Paid that off ASAP. The system is rigged. For example physical therapists now require a Doctorate. Many programs want you to “focus on school” and won’t allow you to have a job. It’s rigged to force loans while the administrative staff quadruple over and over.
 ,If we allow default on student loans and tie repayments to the university's funding watch them suddenly bend over backwards to ensure students get jobs and that tuition stay affordable
 ,This is one area I wish someone on the right would tackle. I don't want my tax dollars paying for some tri-kin purple haired racial gender diaspora graduate. But I know people who are in massive amounts of debt who won't see their quality of life improve for years because of their debt to income ratio. I wouldn't be against something in between. I'm sure youve all read the horror stories or professors forcing you to buy their books new because they want tht money and not because the new books has anything the older versions dont. The books alone could save you a couple grand from your student debt if they weren't so damn expensive. Also I had a cousin who worked collecting student loans. A lot of people would go into debt and then things would happen like a family member would get hurt and they had to leave or they got hurt or they were in the military and fell through the cracks. That last one he said happened more than anyone wants to talk about. Id love to know if its still the case.
 ,You must be higher than giraffe pussy if you think working part time during the school year and full time during the summer will absolve the debt accrued by attending college.
 ,I had scholarships worked 30-39 hrs a week at ~$12/hr and still wound up with a truckload of student loans (all now paid off).  I graduated 12 years ago and tuition has only gone up since then.  This is an oversimplification and grows less accurate by the year.
 ,r/forwardsfromgrandma
 ,Nice strawman meme. Working through college does not remotely pay for it. Even at $20+/hr 25hrs per week you'll barely approach 20-30% of tuition+ housing costs. And how many studentscan get that much pay?As there's not really actual forgiveness/default for federal student loans panel 2 is basically meaningless.Who 'partied through college' graduated and then obtained your money to pay for it? And don't talk to me about the Peace Corps or income based repayment because that actually doesn't get you off the hook.The system is screwed in a lot of ways but this meme utterly fails in a big way.
 ,Pocahontas will bail you out.
 ,I was in the military for 9 years and have my GI bill.  I haven't used it yet partly because I already have a solid and lucrative career with a major aerospace company.  I'm a prime example of the fact that a college degree isn't always necessary to make decent money.  "Decent money" is a relative term anyway.  If you avoid having kids live within your means and focus on saving it turns out that you really don't need that much.  I make less than $60k a year.  As for this particular issue I oppose federal loans and I support industry education - meaning companies are generally interested in sponsoring the education of someone who can be of benefit to them.  A strong performer in biochemical engineering for example might be able to find sponsorship with a petroleum company.  Boeing might be interested in funding someone's education at Embry Riddle.  Meanwhile someone who wants to major in lesbian dance theory would have to fund their own education as there isn't a job market for those "skills" as it should be.
 ,It's because the youth lack personal responsibility. As a millennial I think millennials have ultimately killed it altogether. No one ever takes responsibility for their problems anymore because their problems are always caused by someone else. If there's one thing my generation is great at it's shifting the blame not getting involved to fix a problem and then blaming everyone else. Most of us are petty children who are getting to their late 20s and 30s and still have no idea what it means to be an adult.
 ,500$ payments for an average tuition add that to expenses
 ,Worked 3 part time jobs throughout my college career (4 at one point during the summer) and graduated with minimal debt.  Paid it off two years ago.  It can be done but that means you can't absolve yourself of the responsibility for your debts and defer to the nanny state to erase your mistakes.
 ,Allowing student loans discharge via bankruptcy is the only acceptable solution (not limited to the ridiculous limited standard currently in place) Bankruptcy is intended to provide a fresh start and almost all other types of debt are permissible. Just cancelling debt without any consequences is a terrible approach. Bankruptcy has consequences.
 ,I guess I have no hat in this ring since my college is paid for by the government. I wanted to do 20 years in the Army but I got medically discharged and now I feel awful for having tax payers being forced to pay for my worthless English degree. If I don't get into the MBA program by next year I wasted four years of my life *and* tax payer money.
 ,I worked full time all four years and then some. Still paying my loans but not complaining
 ,Still doesn't address why the cost of education has far outpaced the rate of inflation.  Could it be all the government backed money available?  Nah let's not look there.  Could it be the ridiculous salaries of the football and basketball coaches?.  Nah couldn't be.  What about the funds spent on the sports programs that's over half of the yearly budget?  Nope nothing to see here.
 ,Even working all the time you cannot pay for all of school at most jobs these days. The cost is very inflated. It is 12K per year minimum for UofL not counting other costs
 ,I worked numerous part time jobs and joined the National Guard to help pay my way through. Only got loans to help cover tuition and books and left with minimal debt that I have fully paid off. I'll be damned if I should help pay for those students borrowing living cost so they don't have to work at all for 4+ years.
 ,Damn glad that my minimum wage job pays the $40k a year that my tuition is.....
 ,I mean I raged face almost every weekend in college could’ve graduated early if I really wanted to and also worked a part time job. It’s not ideal but if you learn how to manage your time you really can do it all in school. Sure you might work Friday night then Saturday morning but you still get Saturday night to go out and rip your own face off.
 ,I was signed up for a student loan without knowing what i was signing when i was 18. My dad was paying my way through college and all of a sudden i had a $5k loan... i was going to a 30k/year school and didn't need the money nor did i ever see the money but i was signed off for it. I ended up enlisting and using the gi bill for my mba but there are predatory loans for kids dumb enough (that was me!!!) to sign them.
 ,Plus colleges are just jacking up their prices while loans are trying to catch up.  Its a positive feedback loop.  Basically colleges know they can charge more and loans have to be increased as a result.  Degrees as well don't do what they used to.  I was talking to my roommate earlier today and he was saying on of his girlfriend's coworkers has a masters in psychology and is working at a Starbucks granted she probably doesn't have related work experience but it is an example of how if you don't make the right decisions at the right time you will fail at life.
 ,At the end of the day it comes down to pure fiscal responsibility. I went to school with folks who are in graduate school paid their way through undergrad and will be debt free in the next year or two solely based upon their ability to be fiscally responsible.  Funny how everyone I know who’s still in a bunch of debt are Liberals who went to for psychology or a liberal arts degree and didn’t pursue any higher education.
 ,[Reminds me of the **College educated** "Instagram Star" that has no job skills outside of stripping hooking and supersizing your French fries.  Can't wait to pay for *her* student debt!](https://www.theblaze.com/news/instagram-star-sobs-over-idea-of-getting-real-job)
 ,I got a "full" scholarship to a bottom tier school and worked 1-3 part-time jobs the entire time.  I ended up with about 25000 in debt due to fees books and COL that outmatched my earnings.  My debt is worth it and I'm not upset about paying it off.    I know a lot of people who went to better schools (they could have been accepted into mine and went for free but it wasn't prestigious enough) never worked and ran up loans on student-exchange trips.  They've been able to parlay their better education and more time to devote to it (better grades more extra-curricular activities prestigious unpaid internships) into better paying jobs in the real world. Now they want the government (i.e. middle class tax payers like me) to pay off their $250000 debt.   If I knew it was ever an option I would have done the exact same thing and enjoyed myself instead of nearly killing myself with stress.
 ,To be fair most 18 year olds don't know or can truly comprehend what there getting into when they either take those loans or try to obtain a certain degree.
 ,My first job I was 12 years old I de-tassled corn fields. When I turned 16 my parents made me get a job at McDonalds. I worked fast food for years until I went off to college.                    None of the money I made could possibly begin to pay off college. Full time at minimum wage winds up being $16k/year my college bill was for $30k+ I worked two jobs in my college town (overabundance of labor lead to low hours job + internship) and went to school. I barely survived and owe lots of money in student loans.                         The issue is federally subsidized loan system. It props up high uni pricing and universities themselves use regulations to protect them versus small/new schools and ensuring that everyone at their school has to use their high price garbage like mindtap. If we make it easier for schools to be accredited and drop on-demand student loans we can almost certainly make tuition prices reasonable again.             Though make no mistake about it it is a problem.
 ,I turned down my top 2 choices to attend a local university I hated. Thanks to commuting working part-time and scholarships I graduated debt free this past December. And trust me I don’t come from money— I come from a lower-middle class town and my dad’s a nurse and my mom’s a lunch aid. Didn’t get any special privileges. I’m not footing the bill for others’ irresponsible decisions.
 ,Ummm my wife worked 3 jobs in school all year round and still has plenty of student debt. That's seems like a pretty large over simplification.
 ,I'd find this humorously ironic if it didn't piss me off so much.
 ,What school did that fast food worker in this meme go to? I know it's trying to make a point but come on - no debt? And I would say most kids that didn't come from a wealthy family worked while attending college. I know I did 40+ hours a week and I still had debt.
 ,A lot of these universities are like full time resorts these days. Every student thinks they are entitled to move away for college for the “college experience”. I stayed at home went to community college and then a local 4 year.  I do not want to be stuck paying for someone else’s college bill. Did I want to go move and live on campus 4 hours away? Hell yea I did but I knew my short term sacrifice would lead to long term prosperity. There is such a stigma for the college experience that you have people like Lori Loughlins daughter admitting she’s going to school just for the parties and what not. Don’t even get me started how other folks decided to by pass college and now make less than a college graduate. Yet college graduates now want assistant from these people all while making more than them. Don’t even get me started on how some parents saved for their kids college. The money these responsible parents spent on college for their kids could have been used for other things if they had known debt would just be forgiven. 50k for school being diverted into something else goes a long way. This could of been 50k for the parents retirement or sports camps to give their kids opportunities etc. I can admit the financial institutions financing these kids are out of line because they know student debt can’t be discharged. Only because it can’t be discharged are they willing to give an 18 year old 100k. Take that away and make the interest rate simply inflation and that’s a fair deal.
 ,My dad makes too much money for me to get any government aid. My parents cut me off at 18 because they believe you appreciate more what you earn yourself (which I whole heartedly agree with now that I’m older). I played a sport through college and wasn’t allowed to have a job during season. Worked 2 jobs the rest of the year and still came out in debt. The school I went to was $30000/year not including housing or books. There’s no fucking way I could have paid that off no matter what kind of work situation I was in lol. I have no regrets. I have a good education and a good job because of it but I’ll be paying for it for a long time.
 ,That's a hot opinion you got there. Too bad its wrong. I worked part time through all of school transferred from a CC to a university did Summer school to get out earlier and got a degree in CS. Guess what I still have tons of debt. Suck my privates.
 ,You know this is an issue im not sure why so many people are outraged by. While I'm not just on board with paying off all student debt due to the realities of it I dont understand why some conservatives are determined to do nothing to make the college system better. Right now it really does suck. College degrees almost feel like the new high school diploma. I got a job as a merch at Budweiser stocking beer that required a college degree that I managed to bullshit my way past cause I had a friend there. But that was a $15 an hour labor job that could afford to skip over people without degrees. So why are we so determined to keep college so expensive? Why do we want to set people up to fail dont we want to within reason set them up to succeed? I'd much rather make college more realistic so that people can better themselves than just dumping all this money into straight up welfare.
 ,What part time job could pay for college?!?!
 ,Because they don’t want to

 ,unless you're pandering to Christians. So if Barack or Hillary were speaking to a congregation at a church they'd suddenly be as devout as the day is long. They'd slap on faith like Hillary tries to manage a southern accent
 ,The reason the far left is doing this is for social and political control. It’s that simple. And the moderate left knows it’s insane but they don’t know what to do about it. The goal is to make essentially every group other than straight white men (and women to some degree) band together to fight as a single unit against their perceived oppressors. The problem for them is that this is functionally impossible and we’re seeing the whole thing disintegrate in real time. White people who buy into all this are being told to sit down and shut up for the foreseeable future and if they protest then that’s just their fragile white privilege. Strict followers of Islam cannot work alongside women or gay people. I would argue that Islam as an ideology is incompatible with Western ideals where we value equality under the law personal sovereignty and meritocratic success. It’s falling apart and it’s driving many of them insane.
 ,I'll probably get downvoted but whatever.I'm Catholic - Easter Worshippers meant more to me than Christians.  The terrorists attacked Christians on our most sacred holiday.  The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the pinnacle of our faith and these fools attacked people during this most sacred holiday.To say "Christians" were attacked - Christians could be attacked (and are attacked) at any given moment.  But to attack on Easter - that's just despicable.  I don't have stats (too lazy to look up) but I *think* there have been times in history when folks at war (perceived or real) would avoid attacking during impoortant festivals or religious holidays.  That's what really makes this even more disgusting.  It's a further reminder that Islamic terrorists follow no rules of engagement.  There is no honor in what they're doing.  To attack on Easter and then to specifically call it out - to me that makes it all the more real.I get it - one view is that libs are being so PC or whatever they don't want to say Christians.  Personally and probably due to my biases calling out Easter Worshippers meant more to me personally.Apologies for my rambling.  I'll go back to lurking.
 ,[removed]
 ,I think it's less political than that.  The Associated Press ran an article hours prior to the massacre using the term "Easter worshippers".  Actual members of the press probably run their social media accounts.
 ,Actually its to make people forget.&#x200B;It is not about the 'now'...&#x200B;Its for the months and years after. When people google 'christian' massacres it will not be on any of the popular media. &#x200B;As if it never happened.&#x200B;Some right wing sites will have it as such. And will be branded as 'propaganda'.&#x200B;Amazing how quickly people forget.
 ,It's the same language [Fox news](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4xLoVmXsAAOsPF.jpg:large) uses in places.  "Easter Worshipers" is not somehow derogatory to Christians unless you are looking for an excuse to take offense.

 ,also Julian Castro tweeted pretty much the same thing
 ,They called them Easter Worshippers because people of various religions from all walks of life were attending the ceremony. Their label doesn't matter they were all victims they were all worshippers they shared the same pain. They could've easily said "Christians" but then they would've been discounting the lives of everyone else there who wasn't a Christian see what I'm getting at?

 ,Easter Worshippers sounds like a cult of people who pray to a magic bunny.
 ,Islam is one of the biggest threats to western stability peace and culture.
 ,We should call them StoneWorshippers or MeccaWorshippersNot joking. It's not important where they are when praying: New York Paris London or Madrid. The important thing is that they always pray to Mecca. Why is that? Because the Kaabah is in Mecca. And at the center of the Kaaba (Islam's most sacred place of worship) sits a big black stone. The big black stone is the holiest of the holy in Islam.  So when every Muslim in the world pilgrimages to Mekka to see the black stone wouldn't it be logical to call them StoneWorshippers or MeccaWorshippers?  If it would take off we could dropkick a lot of people with the fact that islam is in reality a pagan religion. They worship a stone. Or shards of a stone now...

That's shameful disgusting and awful but I understand why they did it.What's strange to me is that it didn't occur to them that they would receive backlash for coming up with the bizarre term "Easter worshipers". What's even weirder is that after Hillary coined that term... Barack Obama went ahead and said it too. What the hell? How can they possibly not see the issue with this?The fact that they refused to acknowledge Christian persecution is shameful but the use of the term "Easter woshipers" is just bizarre. I guess... maybe they knew that it would come with backlash but they figured it's ok because the backlash would mostly come from the Christian community.
 ,They are trolling
 ,The same applies to the democratic and Republican parties. Because the republicans routinely clean house to get rid of racists and bigots and the democrats never do it means the dems are perfect little angles and the Republicans are all Hitler
 ,These dems claim Christianity like a badge to get elected to office. It's all for show. They arent really religious at all. Lying Liars is all they are. Next they're going to try and say  "Christians and muslims all worship the same God so they're equal"... hah! ...like the Christian God would require prayer multiple times a day or encourage starving ourselves. Sounds like no God I'd follow.
 ,Unless it's the useful kind of Christianity and the kind that allows your favorite sin.&#x200B;And even then you should berate them for not doing enough for the cause.
 ,I disagree slightly. The Left views Christians as the embodiment of pure evil. Therefore they’re never the victims but always the perpetrators. That’s why they won’t acknowledge the absolute heinous atrocity at Sri Lanka.

 ,President Obama called the situation "sub-optimal."
 ,All these candidates keep trying to out Bernie Bernie and Bernie just keeps moving further left. At least Bernie believes this stuff the rest of these spineless candidates are just too afraid of their own base to call him out. I think Bernie could announce that he’s chosen Nicolas Maduro as his running mate and all his fellow Democrats would just stand around going “great choice Bernie.” All they have to do to beat Trump is to nominate somebody reasonably moderate but they seem intent on screwing that up. It’s like watching a horrific train wreck in slow motion.

 ,We haven’t executed the Boston bomber yet? That piece of shit should have been rotting in Hell  years ago!

 ,Spineless flip-flopper. I don't think she really believes anything. Even Trump was more consistent.
 ,“You can’t beat somebody with nobody.” - Jack Abramoff No doubt I’m indulging in unfounded speculation but if Michelle Obama decided to run Dems Independents and RINO’s would vote for her. She’s probably the only person at this juncture who stands a shot at beating Trump.

 ,She doesn't know what to do when it's not a job you can suck a dick to get.

 ,*"TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY!  TELL ME WHO YOU WANT ME TO BEEEEEEEEE!"*
 ,She probably didn't even have to. She wasn't getting called out for it near as much as Bernie was. I think most news media would be okay with her being President so they're going to cover for her.  They still are a bit sour on Bernie so I think theyll do like they did along with the DNC in 2016 to go after Bernie.

 ,This woman will legitimately say anything to get elected. It’s hard to play to a base that’s all over the board and has a borderline unintelligent base
 ,I'm not sure if this is entirely fair.  Harris said that "we should have the conversation" which as stupid as that is to say is not the same thing as what Bernie said about the issue.
 ,Just yesterday she told CNN's Don Lemon after asking her if she was for prisoners voting "I think it's a discussion we need to have". **That** statement is this lying manipulative power pimp's patent response to yes or no questions. And the media let her fucking *skate*. Kamala chooses her words not carefully but just like Hillary; there's always an out. By definition the word:▪**Deprived** means you lack something▪To **lack** means you don't have enough▪ To not have **enough** means you don't have as much but you do have some**TRANSLATION**: Kamala Harris is for prisoners having *some* voting rights and this likely means the "some" will be the next presidential election.
 ,To be fair the Boston Bomber should be deprived of all rights until execution.
 ,Jump and dance and shake your pants! Let's watch these asshats contort themselves in their attempts to please every potential voter in the lead up to the nomination. Which I predict will go to Biden - the safe choice.
 ,This is a rather interesting development in the 2020 campaign race as up to this point most the candidates have been racing to the left. No progressive idea was too crazy they've all been promising the sun moon and stars trying to stay in the news cycle. Bernie's "leaning in" on this topic but I'm guessing the rest of the field reckons they've hit a wall in terms of voter acceptance for ideas they're bandying about.I'll be curious to see if we see some motion back to the center-left. Pete Buttigieg was the first candidate to kibosh the felon voting rights idea and he's got plenty of momentum. I wonder if we'll see others try to mirror his stances wholesale to see if that gives them a boost with millennials and some separation from the pack.
 ,Not the first time that Kneemala Hoerris tries to "outbern the Bern".Remember when she suddently proposed to get rid of the health insurance private sector altogether.
 ,Until voting is actually granted as a right in the constitution in the united states we will be having this conversation for some time
 ,At least make dual citizenship in congress illegal.  Way too much conflict of interest when our politicians in power have loyalty to other countries.
 ,Just because she is a piece of shit doesn’t mean we should punish other Americans.
 ,There is a difference between dual citizenship and naturalized citizenship. I am a naturalized citizen who does not hold a second (dual) citizenship with my birth country. I am ok with requiring people with dual citizenships to renounce the second one if they want to hold political office in United States. However in my opinion being a naturalized citizen should not be a mark against you in itself no matter what country you came here from.Also according to Israeli policy anyone who claims Jewish faith can claim citizenship in Israel. That doesn't mean anyone who is Jewish has dual citizenship - you still have to actively apply for it.
 ,As others have pointed out here I don’t think the problem is naturalized citizens but instead dual citizenship.Naturalized citizens shouldn’t be barred from running for Congress because that wouldn’t be fair. They have the right as US citizens to represent the people just as much as a natural-born citizen (however they have to be a US citizen to run for office obviously). However if they have dual citizenship in another country then they shouldn’t be allowed to run for office as their allegiance may lie elsewhere.
 ,This seems a tad reactionary. It's a perfectly reasonable thought experiment though. Not out of bounds considering the whole of the left is questioning whether we should get rid of the electoral college.I still say no. I have no problem with refugees in general or foreign born naturalized citizens running for office. Ilhan Omar just happens to suck.
 ,>Simply stated the very notion of American citizenship is under attack.  Fighting to reinvigorate it by making the requirement of natural born citizenship apply equally for all federally elected positions is neither reactionary nor intolerant.  It would be an important step to protect the Republic and it is a conversation we must have.  I agree.
 ,Don't think this is a road worth going down. Even if this was successful there are plenty of people that are natural born citizens who dislike/hate America and preach it's downfall. Much rather be looking at abolishing birth citizenship(must have at least one parent a citizen).
 ,I know a lot of people born in America who would love to see it destroyed. Also I know of plenty foreigners who are so proud of becoming Americans their patriotism inspires me in a way nothing else could. Our birth place in no way defines who we are. In fact I dare say those who struggled and sacrificed everything to become an American are likely better choices than those who were simply given it for nothing
 ,As far as I know she hasn't disputed the immigration fraud accusations either.
 ,There are numerous problems with this woman being in office. None of them require rules changes to fix. Rules changes usually end up being bad in the long term. She needs to be removed from her position either through the ballot box or impeached for crimes committed. This woman is an embarrassment to the entire system and needs to be gone but a rules change isn't needed.
 ,I don't agree with this. Natural Born Citizenship requirements aren't what the US was built on and shouldn't be a door we close to people from other countries. There are mechanisms in place that allow someone to become a Citizen and then to live their lives to their fullest. Ilhan Omar should be treated in the way she deserves to be treated based on how she acts votes and currently thinks about the amazing place she lives in. It seems that people that are never grateful for the wonderful freedoms that the US provides never really understood the struggle to become a citizen in the first place and probably will never be grateful for anything else in life either. If you look deeply at the way she thinks and talks it's evident she feels conflicted about living here affording all the nice things holding office and then having to struggle with her own self-identity.  Maybe its the fame maybe is the power maybe its the religion; Who knows? Likely its a combination of all of it.
 ,If only it were that simple. The sad truth is there are many natural born Americans who hate America with the same passion as the taliban or ISIS.
 ,Pffft that would make sense soooo.....never gonna happen.
 ,Natural born no; dual citizenship is worth a discussion. However regardless of the citizenship I hold it's certainly possible that my allegiance could lie somewhere besides this imperialistic racist misogynist sexist <insert epithet here>its Constitutional republic of ours. THUS it would be great if the voting populace would pay attention to public words and public deeds words as carefully as many pay attention to alleged words and deeds that occur in private.
 ,Absolutely not. I want as many people as possible (not prisoners because I'm not a moron) to feel like they gave a say in how the country works. If you're a citizen you should be able to run and personally I think the native born requirement for president should be removed (it's like the 3000th most important thing that should change!).
 ,Trojan Horse?
 ,no that way Dan Crenshaw can run for president 2024
 ,Yea any federal government position should be limited to people born here who are more likely to have the nation's interests above others
 ,I think naturalized should be able to go up to the State level but not federal.
 ,Absolutely not. But again Ilhan Omar isn't exactly a typical immigrant.  She's the "America owes me" type.  I refuse to believe most legal immigrants have this mindset.
 ,> by raising an accusation of dual loyaltyDual loyalty? That’s a joke she’s has absolutely no loyalty towards this country. She’s an enemy of the American people.
 ,You are aware of how many anti American people are born in america? How about we just don’t let in anti American people who are looking to mooch of America’s tit in the first place?
 ,If this is the worry with naturalized or dual citizenship shouldn't the bigger issue be addressed first where foreign governments are donating to presidential candidates through lobbying loopholes?
 ,No
 ,In my opinion you are disqualified from leadership positions or elected office if you hold dual citizenships.  It's a bad look.
 ,That should be one of the basic requirements.
 ,Trojan Horse?

 ,It's for show mexico's government is making a show of bowing to white house pressure guaranteed 95% of those migrants will be walking north by the end of the week but scattered out so it isn't obvious anymore
 ,>  **Article:**MEXICO CITY—Mexico’s government has started detaining migrants marching in a caravan toward the U.S.-Mexico border marking a policy shift as President Andrés Manuel López Obrador faces rising pressure from the Trump administration to stem the flow of migrants seeking to enter the U.S.Hundreds of Central American and Cuban asylum seekers have been detained in southern Mexico in recent days and sent to overcrowded immigration stations near the country’s border with Guatemala authorities and migration advocates said.On Monday nearly 400 migrants were detained on a federal highway near the town of Pijijiapan in southern Chiapas state many of them families with small children. Other migrants most of them Hondurans and Guatemalans fleeing poverty and violence ran from the police and hid in nearby hills said Rubén Figueroa a human-rights activist who helps caravan migrants in Chiapas.An additional 200 migrants were detained last week as they camped in the village of Mapastepec awaiting temporary visas. Nearly 200 Cubans and a separate group of some 200 Hondurans were also deported in recent weeks Mexican authorities and migrant activists say. “The situation here is chaotic” Mr. Figueroa said.The head of Mexico’s immigration agency said the government offered migrants the chance to apply for visas before Monday’s arrests but that they refused the offer and attacked immigration officials with sticks and stones.The shift in Mexico’s policy comes after senior U.S. and Mexican officials met last month to discuss migration issues with Mexico agreeing to contain the northbound flow of people at migration stations and federal police checkpoints at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec a 125-mile wide stretch of the country between the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean.After taking office in December Mr. López Obrador said his administration planned to focus on migrants’ human rights and regional economic development to tackle migration. His government granted more than 13000 humanitarian visas to Central Americans to stay and work in Mexico and reduced deportations. The government ended the program fast-tracking humanitarian visas in late January.A surge in migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border threatened to spark a political rift with President Trump who said last month he would close the southern U.S. border if Mexico didn’t do more to stop migrants reaching the border.Mr. Trump also said he would cut foreign aid to El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras in retaliation for the migrant caravans that have left the region for the U.S. border with Mexico.In March more than 92000 migrants were detained by U.S. authorities at the U.S.-Mexico border. From October to March some 361000 migrants were apprehended in the U.S. almost as many as were reported for the full 2018 fiscal year.A recent reassignment of U.S. customs and immigration officials along the border led to delays at certain crossings causing long lines of freight trucks waiting to take goods from Mexico to the U.S. Mexico’s foreign ministry said late Monday that it plans to deliver a report to the U.S. on the economic costs of the delays.Mexican authorities deny any policy change on migration. But Interior Minister Olga Sánchez said at a press conference “To keep control of our southern border is not an option it’s an obligation for the Mexican state.”Ms. Sánchez said Mexico has seen unprecedented migrant flows since December from Central America especially Honduras increasing numbers of Cubans coming via Nicaragua and more migrants from Africa and Asia. There is also a previously unseen proportion of women and children among the migrants she said.Earlier on Tuesday Mr. López Obrador said his government is giving migrants options to work in southern Mexico and seeks to protect them from migrant trafficking and greater violence in northern Mexico.“We don’t want them to have free passage and not just for legal reasons but also for security reasons” he said at his daily press conference. “We prefer to attend to the migrant population from Central America in the south the southeast.”He said his government seeks to maintain good relations with the Trump administration.“They would rather there were no migrants” he said of the U.S. “but [migration] is caused by the poverty and abandonment there is in Honduras El Salvador Guatemala.”He reiterated his idea that a long-term solution to the migration problem is development in Central America and mentioned U.S. pledges of support for private and public investment in the region. His government has also agreed to accept Central American asylum seekers in Mexico while they wait for their court hearings in the U.S.But the rising tide of Central Americans is overwhelming shelters and migration stations across the country. Last week the Mexican government opened a temporary shelter for 1500 people in the city of Tapachula near the border with Guatemala. It will also offer temporary visas for migrants from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador to stay in southern Mexico.The crisis in Mexico’s southern border began in late March when a caravan of some 1200 people mostly from Honduras and Guatemala departed from Tapachula. They were joined by a group of some 600 Cubans who were stranded in Tapachula awaiting temporary permits.On April 12 a separate group crossed into Mexico breaking the padlock of the metal fence on the border bridge between Mexico and Guatemala. Others crossed over the shallow Suchiate River a senior Mexican immigration official said.Caravans have become increasingly popular as migrants find safety in numbers. Migrants say it’s also cheaper to travel together. Smugglers also known in the region as coyotes often charge some $8000 per person to take them to the U.S.Ricardo Puerta a Honduran immigration expert said “2019 will be the year of caravans.”
 ,This is just to show a gesture of trying. They don't have the infrastructure to hold vast amounts of illegals in their country.
 ,Let’s see how long this happens. I have a sneaking suspicion this won’t be a long term solution
 ,This wouldn't be an issue for them if they had stopped them at the other borders initially. But they didn't and now they have multiplied their management problems.
 ,About time
 ,Surprise - Surprise! So it's not just the U.S. getting fed up with the caravans of "asylum" seekers.
 ,Welp looks like Bernie Red Pilled Cher.(not really but this is still funny to watch lol.)

 ,>The Florida Senate passed a school-security bill with a provision allowing teachers to be armed despite strong opposition from teacher groups and students.  >  >The measure is aimed at implementing recommendations by a state commission created in the wake of the [shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shooting-at-florida-high-school-authorities-report-1518638881?mod=article_inline) in Parkland Fla. last year that left 17 people dead.

 ,Great!Totally in agreement with such policies.Go Florida!!!
 ,What interesting about this bill is that the media seems dead set on portraying republicans as the ones “doing nothing about mass shootings”.They don’t even cover the fact that Fix NICS was passed - literally just completely ignored it. Now we have a bill constructed over the course of a year and well thought out that will help address school shootings. There’s not going to be a politico piece titled “Republicans new program in florida”. It’s going to be all shitting on the letting teachers carry and talk about how only national government “common sense” gun reform is the only way forward.It gets frustrating. The press is so biased it blows my mind when my more liberal friends can’t tell.
 ,All it will take is one accident for us to remember why we dont intentionally have guns in the classroom. I believe in a person's right to bear arms but I also believe that guns have no place in places of learning (secular or religious). I disagree with this policy. I think there are smarter ways to handle school shootings that arming your teaching staff. there has to be some sensible ground between repealing the 2nd amendment and arming teachers.
 ,Explain something to me. I'm mostly liberal about politics but I'm not the type to be closed minded about everything and I'll side with a logical argument so please don't hate on me for that. Just want to point this out so you guys can understand my train of thought.I see people here praising this idea but it feels scary to me. How would a teacher with no formal combat training be able to deal with an active shooter situation? How will they be able to come to the conclusion that x or y persons are a threat and be able to use deadly force on a minor?It seems like this could snowball into something horrible. Collateral damage mental anguish etc. Could someone help me understand how this would benefit our country?The only reason I could come up with is it would probably act as a way to stop an active shooter situation from starting by means of fear but looking at the type of children who commit these acts they usually go in this with the idea that they won't leave alive. Any thoughts on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
 ,This is fantastic news!  I homeschool my kids now but they went to public school through 5th.  There wasn’t a day that went by that I didn’t wish we had better security.  These are the kind of changes we need!
 ,I think this is a terrible idea. Police with years of training make mistakes in high tension situations involving active shooters. Assuming that after a few hours of training a teacher would be able to responsibly secure and protect a classroom is ridiculous. I know there will be training but I highly doubt it would be as thorough as what officers receive. I see no reason why expanding the current safety officer program would not be a more logical solution to this problem. If the intent is to deter the attacks from happening in the first place I believe that this would be more effective.
 ,I don’t understand why not just hire more security? They’re trained!
 ,Arm bus drivers too. We see more guns at work than teachers
 ,The fact that people on the right view Yang as a moderate shows just how insane the Democrat party has become.Andrew Yang is a left wing progressive. He is not a moderate or a centrist in any sense. He is staunchly left wing with left wing ideas. But he presents these left wing ideas in a respectable intelligent way. His ideas are wrong but he’s still respectable and is deserving of being in the conversation.But my point is that the Democrats have gone so far off the deep end with their socialist idiocy  with their lack of ideas and with their general *“everyone should get everything for free and if you oppose that you’re a racist!”* mentality  that even a staunch progressive like Yang seems outright conservative by comparison to these nutcases.
 ,A lot of liberals hate Yang because he refuses to buy into their race/class war rhetoric. His policies also stand in contrast compared to candidates like Bernie or Warren. He is against free college and full student loan debt forgiveness. He wants to instead help those with student debt through a 10 year pay back program. He also proposes to make a push for important trade skill careers such as plumbing and appliance repairs that young people have been moving away from to pursue arts degrees. In terms of healthcare he wants to offer a public option to compete against private insurance rather than abolish private insurance. He also doesn't want to get rid of the electoral college.His policies are much more realistic and achievable because he's not a politician. He doesn't give lip service to make people feel good about morals. He simply offers non-stop practical solutions to credible threats. Anyone with two eyes can see the retail stores closing fast food workers being replaced taxi and truck driver jobs becoming irrelevant and call centers starting to use AI more and more.His idea isn't to fear these threats but to embrace the changes. We are living in the fourth industrial revolution whether you can see it or not. Our definition of work needs to change because over 50% of current jobs will no longer exist or will be changed completely within the next 10 years.* https://vitalvegas.com/mgm-resorts-to-replace-bartenders-with-machines-no-really/* https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/22/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-robo-taxi/* https://www.ttnews.com/articles/embark-self-driving-truck-completes-coast-coast-test-run* https://www.livescience.com/61994-flippy-burger-flipping-robot-flops.htmlIf you would like to know more check out one of his talks on this subject:* SXSW talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alRgSjWT2RI* Joe Rogan: https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8* Ben Shapiro: https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw* Lawrence Lessig: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjiHwx6bpkg

 ,Seems like he has some clever and unusual ideas I hope he does well.
 ,Dude is a gun grabber. No ty
 ,Even though I don't agree with much of the policies he proposes I'm glad to see he is the one democratic candidate who is willing to talk to the other side of the aisle.
 ,Honestly his plans for gun policies make a lot of sense with the exception of the "high capacity magazines" part and the banning of suppressors. I don't like the fingerprint part either but everything else kinda makes sense.

 ,How do you expect to garner business if you openly discriminate against anyone. No one no matter how "woke" they proclaim to be is willingly going to let themselves be charged extra for being born as they are.
 ,How does this "woke" stuff work exactly?   Least Woke = I discriminate against a group of people.  More Woke = I don't discriminate against any groups of people.  MOST WOKE = I discriminate against a *different* group of people.
 ,Chalkboard states a 21% premium for men. Feminism Inflation.
 ,I thought that it fulfilled just two leftist tropes before seeing this:Rule #1: women have priority seating. Rule #2: men will be charged an 18% premium to reflect the gender pay gap (2016) which is donated to a women's service.*Rule #3 respect goes both ways.*Feminist vegans with double standards. Absolutely hilarious.I wonder what the significance of the number 18 really is here. Perhaps the combined IQ of the restaurant's owners?
 ,They already have ladies night at clubs and bars damn. It is never enough for them.
 ,Are they asking each customer their gender? Surely you can't assume someone's gender based on their appearance and biology right?
 ,Free market solution to discriminatory businesses practices. Gotta love it
 ,Once again capitalism wins over shitty ideas
 , “The man tax blew up the internet an idea that we didn’t think was all too radical yet the way the world responded showed us how fragile masculinity is and solidified the necessity for us to confront and dismantle patriarchy.”What.
 ,Capitalism is the least discriminatory economic system in the world. Case and point
 ,Can't tell if the redheaded person in the article is man or a woman.
 ,I love watching liberals freak out over something that doesn't exist.
 ,Gee I wonder why?
 ,I own a businessI am oppressed
 ,Someone should have mansplained free market to them.
 ,>the world responded showed us how fragile masculinity is.”No you were mean and nasty to half the population and based a tax on a fallacy usually when you fail you can hope to learn something they didnt learn a fucking thing.
 ,I'd like to know what kind of jerk offs spent over $5k at this place?
 ,Go woke go broke.
 ,Capitalism doing its job.Shitty business models don't last as they shouldn't.
 ,The wage gap isn’t even real
 ,Get woke go broke strikes again
 ,They really think they failed due to fragile masculinity?  How about selling a product most people don't want in the first place plus being overcharged because you are a man?
 ,Is there any better way to lose 50% of your customers?
 ,Well when you alienate 50% of the people that could possibly come to your cafe...
 ,So...what about the other 57 genders - do they get a discount?
 ,If I remember correctly didn’t they give men a choice if they wanted to pay the extra tax?
 ,I bet it was shitty coffee and smelled like b.o.
 ,Lmao
 ,I wish I could devote an entire year's upvotes to this post.
 ,Well they should stop their toxic femininity. Women and men are equal now we don't need this madness anymore.
 ,Lol it was bad business practice to begin with. Capitalism does not discriminate.
 ,s h o c k i n g
 ,Well it would happen eventually these woke businesses will never be able to survive and that makes me so damn happy.
 ,LGBTIQA+ wait now what does this mean?
 ,Good riddance. This is the free market at work. I support the right of businesses to discriminate but as others have said if it went the other way they'd be shut down in no time. We already live in a society with explicit legal discrimination against men whites and Asians in favour of various "victim" groups. The left cares about end results the right cares about principles.
 ,How self-unaware do you have to be to simultaneously think there is a wage gap between men and woman in favor of men but also to drive away the customers with the supposedly increased amount of disposable income.
 ,There's no better way to take a stand against structural inequality and oppression than using structural inequality and oppression as your business model.
 ,Sometimes I wonder if articles like these are written to get conservatives all riled up which generates clicks and add views. It feels like we're being played by big media to stir up emotions and outrage so we can link this article to other like-minded individuals.
 ,I’m not really conservative and found this in r/all but I totally agree with y’all on this one.
 ,\> charges men extra\> goes out of bussiness\> blames men
 ,female priority service and male surcharges the place was even called handsome her some people just cannot divorce themselves from gender politics. it's their entire identity. they could've just had a set percentage of *all* sales donated to the charity but no it has to serve as some kind toll as punishment.
 ,You just gotta laugh at these idiot fems.  Dumber than a box of rocks.
 ,Coulda seen that one coming haha
 ,Ha ha!
 ,You can’t run a business based on something that doesn’t exist. There is no pay gap. Having a business strategy on a lie you refuse to see as such is no strategy.  #equality
 ,They did the "man tax" to get attention to push their agenda. They did it to piss people off. And so it did. They're only closing now so they had like 3 years in business. That's something. But to blame closing on the very people you intended to piss off? Give me a break. (Also that person in the photo looks rather like a young Dave Foley with red hair. )
 ,Out of business by openly attacking half of the population? I love the free market.
 ,LMFAO
 ,[Deary me...](https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g947958-d12785840-r520137071-Handsome_Her-Brunswick_Moreland_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html)
 ,WOW. Regardless on ones thoughts on these issues acts like these will only hurt their causes. No one but 14 year olds on twitter are claiming the 'wage up' is straight up increasing the prices when a women tries to check out. By framing it in such a manner it only makes them seem childish even to their own base. Plus by actively discriminating it frames THEM as the sexists.&#x200B;>Handsome Her was “taken aback to find that many people in the LGBTIQA+ community have as much aversion to us using the word ‘lesbian’ as the men’s-rights activists.”When even the LGBTQ community is even mad at a 'pro-women protest' you know you have gone too far left.&#x200B;>rule #1: women have priory seating  >  >...  >  >rule #3: respect goes both waysHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
 ,>In its struggle against the patriarchy Handsome Her was surprised to learn “that it wasn’t only men’s rights activists targeting” the business but also those within its own community. Handsome Her was “taken aback to find that many people in the LGBTIQA+ community have as much aversion to us using the word ‘lesbian’ as the men’s-rights activists.”This is what happens when you have people with not one lick of basic economics running a business.  TBH I don't give a shit about their opinions but I sure won't be paying 18% more b/c they chose to single me out.  There are probably plenty of coffee shops around the area that would serve me w/o the bullshit.They also pigeon-holed themselves but not serving take away cups.  Not only would a man need to pay 18% extra but also would need to waste time sitting and drinking the coffee when they can grab it to go.
 ,The market has spoken and it said a gender tax is fucking stupid.
 ,Bad marketing. Just sell everything at the higher price and give an 18% discount to women. Everyone would love that.
 ,Just more proof that feminism is NOT about equality but about female supremacy.Get it through your skulls folks and STOP trying to defend that cult!
 ,This is by far one of the most outrageous things I’ve ever read. I can’t believe they were even allowed to do that in the first place.
 ,👏get👏WOKE👏go👏BROKE👏
 ,I can see paying once then not going to the place again.A place like that would have to push for first time customers at all times because what moron would pay more for the same food continually ??
 ,And I bet they’ll blame it on the free market and use it to push a socialist agenda.Also how do they determine who’s a guy and who’s a girl? Do they ask everyone or do they _assume their gender?_
 ,You know it’s bad when you read a serious article and think it’s something out of The Onion.
 ,I might be wrong but isn't charging more for males discrimination?
 ,And of course it’s all mens’ fault. Lol!! What you women can overcome it with your empowerment and inflated egos??
 ,A company that openly discriminates went out of business? Color me shocked.
 ,Funny how the person in the picture is dressed and has hair just like a man would.  People can dress how ever the hell they want but don’t hate on men and try and look like one.
 ,Whoops the market isn’t sexist
 ,How was that legal?
 ,Title says 18% but sign says 21%
 ,It says 21% on the sign right next to that smirky dude
 ,AWESOME!!! LOL
 ,"Dismantling patriarchy" seems to have come at odds with all their operational costs
 ,Honk honk 🤡
 ,While trying to emulate and identify as men. Makes sense. Girl power!
 ,[Cue the music](https://youtu.be/Ag1o3koTLWM)
 ,This doesn't even make monetary sense. If women make 25% less i.e. $0.75 per dollar it doesn't make sense to charge men 25% more because $0.75 plus 25% does not equal $1 you would have to increase the fees to 33% to compensate for a 25% deficit. Instead it would be a better policy to give an 18% discount to women or charge men \~22% more to compensate for an 18% deficit.
 ,>"Men are charged a 21% premium"Solution: Identify as a woman.
 ,Woohoo!But really. Being feminist should be advocating females having the \*exact\* same rights as men it sounds like this cafe wasn't feminist but rather anti-male. In fact it was probably doing more harm to females as it's attempting to create a divide between men and women.In which case nobody wins.
 ,So a place that serves food was more concerned with politics and gender theory than food and went out of business. This isn't really shocking but I bet they missed the point and blamed men for it.
 ,Some rich liberal is going to buy their cafe if you guys keep advertising this
 ,wow thats cold!
 ,GET WOKE GO BROKE!!!! 😂😂😂😂🔥
 ,A lesson unlearned I am afraid.
 ,Lmao
 ,ITT: a lot of hate against people who agree that this is bullshit
 ,Perhaps you just have shitty food and drink?
 ,Oh no that sucks.
 ,Wonder if Ben Shapiro will mention this on his podcast anyways it's good to see that the easiest way to destroy your business is by getting woke.
 ,Clearly wasn't for the Woke Broke Bloke....

 ,"fragile masculinity" listen you silly bitch you alienated half your clientele
 ,It’s the blue tax
 ,http://imgur.com/ARqSU9m
 ,How exaclty is this not gender discrimination and a lawsuit waiting to happen?
 ,hahaha
 ,Hmm.. It's almost as if alienating off half your potential market is a bad business plan.
 ,I’m shocked!
 ,Money does not give a shit about your gender perspective race or anything really.  Either you want the money or you don't.
 ,I mean... most businesses fail...
 ,Rip
 ,Fuuuuuuuuck you. Golly a lot of white people think they're supreme over blacks. Gosh they should open a restaurant where blacks aren't welcome but they can shit in the gutter if they need to use the restroom. Fuckin' idiots. Rabid victims they are they will NEVER connect the dots to their failure.
 ,I don't understand how they didn't get sued for discrimination. Isn't it illegal to do this?
 ,This has got to break some sort of law.
 ,*happiness noise*
 ,Surely such enlightened people wouldn’t dare assume my gender and apply the tax based on assumptions would they?
 ,Damn that liberal arts degree really worked well
 ,“Women have priority seating”Why would any man want to go there if there’s a chance you’d have to get up and leave at any pointDelusional
 ,"18% fee? DID YOU JUST ASSUME MY GENDER?! I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I AM A PROUD TRANSSPECIES XX BIASSED SELF IDENTIFIED BLACK PROTODRAGONKIN YOU FUCKING SHITLORD".And enjoys your soy based hormone addles mantitty growing moccalattechino for only $1499.
 ,I consider myself a feminist but I would never support a cafe like that. It's totally sexist and unfair. It's extremists like this that give feminism a bad name and makes everyone hate the F word.
 ,Imagine being so fucking stupid that you open a cafe and discriminate against a person and charge them because of something they can't control like their fucking gender. Then imagine being *even more stupid* by going and posting on your fucking facebook that you're closing down and oh yeah those people you discriminated against? Its their fault... *sobs in leftwing*
 ,It says 21% on tha board
 ,But the thing is if I seen that I'd probably just walk out and find a new coffee shop. I get that it's going to charity but you're forcibly making a male to make a donation. What ever happened to a tip jar or charity box.
 ,\> “House Rules Rule #1: women have priority seating. Rule #2: men will be  charged an 18% premium to reflect the gender pay gap (2016) which is  donated to a women’s service. Rule #3 respect goes both ways” a  chalkboard in the cafe read.&#x200B;Oh the irony. Yes respect goes both ways. Pretend to fight for equality for all being a feminist yet has obvious prejudices towards men and as a result go out of business.  Way to alienate your customers and business. GG?
 ,Make a Political statement // Make a Profit-- Pick 1 --
 ,Hating men is not feminist.
 ,lol i’d walk in and tell them i’m female even tho i look like a white male. “aRe YoU aSsUmInG mY gEnDeR” then tell them their coffee sucks.
 ,This is why they need socialism.
 ,The "tax" was used as a means to raise money for charity
 ,If I lived in the same town as this cafe I would have went in and ordered something just so when they hit me with their Man Tax I could yell "Excuse me did you just assume my gender!?"And then I storm out without paying lol.
 ,I like how they claim they've made $1100 for charity.  So. For 2 years. Men only spent $5500 there.  Hmm. I wonder why you went under
 ,Learn to code
 ,I have a great idea to destroy the sexists. we will be sexist! It’s perfect!
 ,There were no guys to pay for dinner lol
 ,Well the transexual coffee shop across the street only charges a 13% "Man Tax" so there's that. Once again capitalism prevails.
 ,They continuously call the "patriarchy" fragile.  If all it takes is a coffee shop charging extra to men to wound the "patriarchy" then how has is it still in place?  Shouldn't it all be crumbling down?
 ,I feel like the "Man Tax" comes from making men spend more because in certain jobs they apparently get paid more than woman in the same position. It's rediculous to assume that this is the case everywhere. All the women at my job get paid more than the men which is interesting..
 ,What surprises me is that they raised $1100 from charging men a 21% premium. I thought men would avoid that place like the plague. But then again it was a vegan cafe. So maybe there were vegan men desperate for vegan food and there was no other option nearby? But still vegans are already a small subset of people. By alienating vegan men no wonder they went bust.
 ,Lmao get fucked that's what they deserve for trying to virtue signal with their sjw bs
 ,I actually know this cafe and don't know why no one's mentioning how it's voluntary? Like you don't have to pay extra if you don't want to even though I says on the blackboard no one asks there's just a tip jar.
 ,Easy solution make the women pay
 ,Hahahaha glorious justice
 ,Thats cold!
 ,thats cold!
 ,Cunts.
 ,Dumb cunts. 😂
 ,Why is this on r/conservative ? I’m super liberal and even I think this is nuts

 ,avoid r/PoliticalHumor and r/politics like the plague.
 ,I wonder if Obama and his ilk think people are too dumb to know that 'Easter Worshippers' are by default 'Christian?'
 ,You have chosen... wisely.
 ,Ok Obama say it: Ramadan Worshipers. Say it. Let's see what happens.
 ,Kinda sucks that this top-quality meme/joke which is much more humorous than a lot of the tweets over at r/PoliticalHumor probably won’t be accepted or liked at all because of political bias. Sheesh. How can they beg the world to be nonpartisan when they can’t even take jokes from the other side of the aisle?
 ,This is well done my friend.
 ,As long as the memes aren’t boomer-style. So cringe.
 ,Stressing this again: that originated with the Associated Press.  Someone in the press runs their social media.
 ,He went to harvard and the best he could come up with is Easter worshipper?/sBut kidding asides I believe this was orchestrated to trigger the Repubs
 ,I find this weird as Obama is protestant Christian!
 ,Pray for the bunnies
 ,Post it there anyways! Who cares about downvotes.
 ,Keep them memes coming
 ,These are rookie numbers. You’ve gotta boost these numbers up! Come post on r/the_donald
 ,I’ll post it with your permission
 ,Meme like this are valuable because it takes no level of real understanding of politics or knowledge of current affairs for you to know what’s going on and for it to make sense. If you care enough you can learn more. If not you’re still left with the idea that Barry Soweto is not on the up and up. Can be digested by the apolitical masses. Keep it up.
 ,Post it there anyway
 ,Again we show sympathy not only to those who were harmed and died but to the political target of the action.They should have said "Christians and Easter Worshippers^tm" instead they explicitly exluded Christians the Christian community was the target but not only Christians died therefore I can reasonably state that my phrase is the more appropriate phrase.
 ,That is actually really good lol laughed for like 5 minutes straight. Even r/politics is basically a Liberal subreddit
 ,Would work better with Hillary
 ,Reposted on r/PoliticaclHumor. Let's watch the downvotes roll in. [https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/bguw9r/new\_format/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/bguw9r/new_format/)
 ,When you hate a voting demographic so much that you can’t even say their name.We’re like Voldemort.Oh and Voldemort is gay btw. Confirmed by J.K. Rowling
 ,Who cares what it's called? You're getting far too hung up a name. I knew that Easter coincided with Passover since I was a young boy but why does its name matter? Btw where would Muslim extremists go to kill mass numbers of pagans? They were targeting Christians attending Easter mass. It's clear as day.

 ,So I was raised a Christian as were most of my friends and naturally my family. But we don't regularly attend Church and are mostly apathetic towards religion. Calling the folks who were murdered on Easter Sunday 'Easter worshippers' separates those who practice more regularly from those who dont go at all or only go at Xmas. It's the media and the left's way of presenting them as RADICALS.
 ,The left wing indoctrination in the public school system is unacceptable. I would hope to see this administration make progress fixing it but it runs very deep.
 ,Why are we covering a recent election in AP US History.... that’s more like civics
 ,Not surprising. Our AP US history textbook in 2009-10 was straight up Howard Zinn’s “People’s History if the US”
 ,The left always calls him a racist.  Am I missing something?  I don't see that at all.  They must think repetition will make it stick.
 ,Any AP History teacher worth his/her tenure is going to use this text as an example of media bias the creep of political opinion into what should be strictly fact based material and as a jumping off point for presenting two sides of the issues.
 ,Trump won't be on the APUSH exam for a lonnggg time maybe 20-30 years from now. It seems completely unnecessary to even include him in the book right now. When I took the test the most recent material was from the 1990s.

 ,Yeah you can’t just walk up to a country and get in for free no questions asked. I think a lot of people calling for letting them in don’t understand the implications of suddenly letting hundreds of thousands of migrants into a country. It would be disastrous. Just google “what happens if america suddenly decides to let everyone in”.It’s sad that people migrating are in such shit that they are migrating. It is also disgraceful for them to think that they can just bypass everyone who has been waiting for a visa for 10+ years. Not surprisingly America has the longest green card backlog by a long shot.If you are not willing to follow the legal guidelines of entering and residing in a country you should not be allowed entrance. Plain and simple. When they started their caravans - “they can’t turn away and ignore this many people” all while they are doing something illegal themselves and knowingly. They are saying “nope I can’t/won’t wait my place in line for the next 22 years for a green card like everyone else. I want in now”America has never changed its policy that they are not letting these people in. It goes against the laws of fair entrance to everyone else in the world to let them in.At the end of the road these people will reach America and be turned away because they are choosing to try entering in an illegal manner.
 ,Mexican soldiers have been riding shotgun for drug traffickers at our borders for years and both Mexican soldiers and police have been complicit in the human trafficking that funnels people through Mexico and up to the US. There were constant incursions by Mexican soldiers during the Bush years and every time we confronted Mexico they plead ignorance and that those weren't Mexican soldiers those men in Mexican uniforms and carrying Mexican standard issue weaponry.
 ,Not policies one singular policy would cost 32 trillion this the direct cost to the US gov at best.One policy that would nearly double the national budget in one fell swoop.
 ,Hard to imagine what it is like to live as a useful idiot in a world removed from reality.  And every time you scream for something to solve a non existent problem you are just too fucking dumb to realize how you are being manipulated by the leftist elites.
 ,Some conservatives I know deny man-made climate change or believe vaccines cause autism. We should do our best to change that within the Conservative community.However the left is also anti-Science in its own way. For example they will vehemently deny that there are biological differences between man and women. They will fervently deny that there are real differences in biology cognitive capacity and IQ between different ethnic groups which lead to problems of underperformance when you have extreme multiculturalism or mass migration. The left's anti-Science positions are more insidious because they have the backing of academics and intellectuals who try to cloak all pertinent discussion in a cloud of "well it's complicated...we can't really say for sure and if you keep talking about this you're a bigot!"

 ,When I was a freshman in college we had to take a class on diversity. In the first session of the first class they tell us how all stereotypes are false and anyone who believes a stereotype is an idiot.I raised my hand and politely explained how that's a stereotype; he just stereotyped everyone in the world who believes in stereotypes.To make a long story short we argued for a bit but it ended with "I'm the teacher and you have to pass this class in order to graduate."Message received. People who stereotype are idiots and now I can confirm that's true for at least one of them.

The Mexican troops reportedly removed a weapon from the American soldier who was armed.> the Mexican military members believed they were on Mexican territory at the time they confronted the Americans.

They then conference with the dem politician and tell them "hey even we can't sell that lie or that bullshit to the idiots" and the dem pol relents.  I fully expect bernie to lie his way out of what he clearly said.
 ,CNN’s bias even within the democrats is palpable
 ,Funny watching the Dems all try to out-left him on this in half-assed ways.  Guys - voters do not care about policy: they care about personality.  We are a people who like feeling like celebrities relate to us.  Act more angry and senile and praise Northern Europe and curse American values and you can get the nomination on any political platform you choose so long as your tweet game is also strong.
 ,Bernie does NOT WANT the nomination.  He just wants to raise a butt load of money for his next house then walk away.  This is why he keeps playing the NutJob and spitting out stupidity.   He gets media coverage raises money from the gullible and no chance of being nominated.

Now look at the states suing DJT for the wall and which ones allow driving privileges for illegals.Once the wall was being put up they reach for 16 year olds. Now it’s prisons. The voter pool for Dems is being dried up.
 ,What a dumb idea. Many prisons are in less populated areas they would constitute a significant voting block which doesn't actually live in the community. They would be voting for local candidates and issues like who is on the school committee and other ideas that affect the community but have little bearing on the prisoners themselves. Nothing could go wrong there.

 ,The article doesn’t claim that. But it has a point. It says sexual orientation is determined by several factors that also include social factors. The idea that “born that way” is established science is also wrong. It has not been determined that homosexuality is or isn’t a disorder. Homosexuals should have rights just like everyone else should not because they were born that way but because they are individuals with hopes and dreams like everyone else.

 ,Interesting article.  And I could see how gender fluidity and all that jazz contradicts itself of the "born this way."I think though if one wanted to provide more evidence of this thesis we would need more research/ citations.Edit: on another note that damn song is now stuck in my head...so thanks for that.
 ,I think of it like food. Everyone naturally has different tastes in food but you can grow to like or hate some foods more.But also some people are just allergic to some foods and can't ever have them. Which is fine. They just shouldn't force their children (or other people) to also never have those foods.Oh and we don't let kids eat only whatever food they think is their favorite that week or every kid is gonna grow up on a diet of chicken nuggets and ice cream. When they get older they can eat whatever food they want.

 ,Let's think what costs more? $50k that you have to pay off or $5-10k in extra taxes to pay for free college for others and to pay back that debt every year for the rest of your whole life?
 ,I can get behind some relief for older loans especially ones that still have fairly high balances.When I say relief I mean things like freezing the interest rates reducing rates or even cutting it to zero in some cases. Maybe even forgive some of the penalties like late fees or portions of massive interest debt as in you borrowed 100k and after 20 years still owe 100k+.But to say that we're going to pay off large portions of your debt because you made a choice and now can't or don't want to deal with it? Nope. Life doesn't and shouldn't work that way.We can also certainly discuss the culture of the lending practices whether they're predatory or if people were "brainwashed or tricked" into thinking they had to go to college but to ask the government to bail us out everytime we as a people do something stupid is ludicrous. People are and should be smarter than this.The Democratic candidacy has become a race of who can offer the most "free stuff" and spend their to "prosperity" while simultaneously attacking the current administrations spending habits.

 ,Ahh the poor little rat is going to get rat fucked.  I'll play the world's smallest violin for him.However I'll note that prosecutors threatening to put away family members as leverage is something right out of the Nazi play book.  Why the fuck are they allowed to use his wife's crimes as leverage against Cohen.  Having Cohen plead guilty to something he doesn't think he's guilty of and then letting his wife go is both corrupt and evil. A similar tactic was used on Manafort and Flynn.
 ,>Michael Cohen has disavowed responsibility for some of the crimes to which he has pleaded guilty privately contending in a recent recorded phone call that he hadn’t evaded taxes and that a criminal charge related to his home-equity line of credit was “a lie.”As he prepares to begin a three-year prison term on May 6 Mr. Cohen President Trump’s former lawyer expressed dismay during the conversation that after testifying for more than 100 hours to federal and congressional investigators about his work for Mr. Trump—including the coordination of hush-money deals with two women—he remained “a man all alone.”“You would think that you would have folks you know stepping up and saying ‘You know what this guy’s lost everything’” Mr. Cohen said during the March 25 call recorded without Mr. Cohen’s knowledge by the actor and comedian Tom Arnold. Mr. Arnold a vocal critic of President Trump who first made contact with Mr. Cohen in June provided the recording to The Wall Street Journal for review.“My family’s happiness and my law license” Mr. Cohen continued. “I lost my business…my insurance my bank accounts all for what? All for what? Because Trump you know had an affair with a porn star? That’s really what this is about.”Lanny Davis a lawyer for Mr. Cohen said: “Michael has taken responsibility for his crimes and will soon report to prison to serve his sentence. While he cannot change the past he is making every effort to reclaim his life and do right by his family and country. He meant no offense by his statements.”A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.In pleading guilty in August Mr. Cohen explicitly admitted to his crimes before a judge to make it clear he was acting knowingly. “I take full responsibility for each act that I pled guilty to” he said at his sentencing hearing in December. Since then he has been attempting to have his sentence reduced by aiding congressional investigations.Mr. Cohen’s private comments are unlikely to help his cause with the federal prosecutors who would have to endorse a shorter term behind bars legal experts said adding that they wouldn’t lead to an increase in his sentence either unless the government were to bring new charges against him.Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges brought by New York federal prosecutors including campaign-finance violations in connection with hush-money payments to the two women the former porn star Stormy Daniels and the former Playboy centerfold model Karen McDougal. Mr. Trump denies he had sex with either woman.Mr. Cohen also admitted to five counts of evading personal income taxes and one count of understating his debt and expenses in an application for a $500000 home-equity line of credit or Heloc.Mr. Cohen testified in February in the House of Representatives that Mr. Trump committed crimes including directing the hush-money schemes during the 2016 presidential campaign involving the two women. “I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter in December.New York prosecutors have asserted previously that Mr. Cohen has been loath to acknowledge his false statements to banks. “This signals that Cohen’s consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting that his remorse is minimal and that his instinct to blame others is strong” prosecutors wrote in a December filing.Before his sentencing Mr. Cohen’s then-lawyer pushed back on the tax charges telling the judge he had merely failed to identify all his income on bank records he gave his accountant. Prosecutors argued the tax evasion was willful.On the March call Mr. Cohen seemed to walk back parts of his admission. “There is no tax evasion” he said on the call. “And the Heloc? I have an 18% loan-to-value on my home. How could there be a Heloc issue? How? Right?…It’s a lie.”In the 36-minute recording Messrs. Cohen and Arnold covered a range of issues from the legal troubles of former Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti to Mr. Trump’s affinity for the leader of North Korea.Mr. Arnold said he made the recording without Mr. Cohen’s knowledge. Mr. Cohen has himself surreptitiously recorded conversations. During a raid of his home office and hotel room in April 2018 the Federal Bureau of Investigation seized recordings the lawyer made while talking to journalists political allies and others including Mr. Trump. During the call last month Mr. Arnold praised Mr. Cohen for standing against the president. “You are a hero and you’re not alone” Mr. Arnold said.Mr. Cohen’s lawyers earlier this month sought help from the Democratic chairmen of four House committees in obtaining a reduced sentence for their client asking them to send the legal team a letter saying that Mr. Cohen had “substantially cooperated with Congress” and that congressional investigators would need access to him to complete their probes. Rep. Adam Schiff (D. Calif.) chairman of the House Intelligence Committee told CNN he doesn’t involve himself in sentencing matters “as a practice.” There is no indication other lawmakers complied.Speaking privately with Mr. Arnold Mr. Cohen said he had pleaded guilty to the charges in August because “they had me on campaign finance” and prosecutors were targeting his wife. Mr. Cohen had failed to disclose to the Internal Revenue Service more than $2.4 million in interest payments he had received from loans some of which were deposited in an account under his wife’s name New York federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing. Mr. Cohen’s wife declined to comment.“I love this woman and I am not going to let her get dragged into the mud of this crap” Mr. Cohen said. “And I never thought the judge was going to throw a three-year fricking sentence.”Mr. Arnold who has been on a yearslong search for unaired footage of Mr. Trump on the set of “The Apprentice” said he called Mr. Cohen on March 25 to follow up on their interactions from last summer. In June 2018 Mr. Arnold tweeted a picture of himself with Mr. Cohen and said they were working together to take down Mr. Trump though he later walked that back after Mr. Cohen denied it.In an interview Mr. Arnold said he made the call to give Mr. Cohen moral support. He said he recorded the conversation because Mr. Cohen “tapes everything and I wanted to remember what we talked about.”The two men spoke on the day that Mr. Avenatti was arrested in New York and charged in federal court with trying to extort Nike Inc. and separately with bank fraud in California. Mr. Avenatti who has since been charged with embezzling from clients has denied any wrongdoing and said he has been targeted for his opposition to Mr. Trump. While representing Ms. Daniels whose real name is Stephanie Clifford Mr. Avenatti was sharply critical of Mr. Cohen.“Look at what’s happening to Avenatti—it’s called karma boomerang” Mr. Cohen told Mr. Arnold. “The guy lied about me every single day right? And the world loved it.”Asked for comment Mr. Avenatti called Mr. Cohen “a convicted felon who tampered with an election for Trump’s benefit.”“Everything I said about him was 100% true including that he is ignorant as further evidenced by his use of the term ‘karma boomerang’” he said.Mr. Cohen also criticized the president. “I always knew you know who he was and what he was and so on but it didn’t really matter because it’s—he’s a small microcosm of New York real estate.” Mr. Cohen suggested it was a “very different” matter to accept Mr. Trump’s behavior as president.“They put sanctions on North Korea and he removes them because he likes Kim Jong Un because he’s ‘my friend’?” Mr. Cohen said alluding to how the president described the North Korean leader in a February tweet and to sanctions Mr. Trump decided not to apply in March. “What kind of nonsense is this?”—Nicole Hong Rebecca Ballhaus Joe Palazzolo and Rebecca Davis O’Brien contributed to this article.

 ,The SGM nailed it.  Great article!
 ,Good read.  Honestly the fact that she's lamenting the deaths of Aidid's people who forced her to flee from her home MORE than the American soldiers who gave their lives really says something.
 ,Oh the irony.  And why is she still talking? Go away. Go retire. Go live your end years in peace away from politics. You're never going to be President and most everyone wants nothing to do with you. Just shut the hell up and disappear already.
 ,Hillery Clinton is a walking example of someone who should be in jail for obstruction of justice.  She runs an illegal email server chocked full of classified data she lies that it contains no classified data and then has the server wiped 3 weeks after it's subpoenaed in order to hide that it's full of classified data.  She committed a crime and then committed a second crime by destroying evidence in order to impede the investigation into her original crime.  That's Obstruction of Justice.Trump on the other hand committed no underlying crime committed no crimes that impeded an investigation and did nothing to impeded the investigation like claiming executive privileged to cover up a crime that he was aware of.  There's no case for Obstruction of Justice with Trump.
 ,Funny.  You weren't.

 ,Interesting argument and one that has applicability in other areas. However one side effect of this will be increased data collection and databasing of information.  This will encourage parking enforcement to use ALPR (Automated License Plate Recognition) to record the date/location of a car to determine weather or not a ticket should be given.  However that data will likely never be thrown away after the car leaves or the ticket is issued.  I wouldn't be surprised if it were stored long term and would be searchable by other members of the law enforcement community within that area who could use it to determine patterns of travel for either a suspect or someone they may have a beef with.

 ,Remember Obama exercised executive privilege to protect Holder from perjury after being caught lying to Congress. The House even voted to hold him in contempt.

 ,McCain was a Rino who's sheer anger over Trump's personal attacks blinded him to the larger issues. As juvenile as Trump's pre-election posturing was McCain's inability to get past it (Cruz and Rubio did!) led to his emotions overriding logic. He didn't screw Trump on ending Obama-Care - he screwed the American people.Still and always a war hero but not in control of his emotions.

 ,Absolutely disgusting politics.Americans died in Sri Lanka. Americans didn't die in New Zealand.Where are her priorities?
 ,Democrats hate Christians
 ,The Left cannot tolerate Christians being acknowledged as  victims
 ,Has no one told her what to say yet?
 ,She doesn't wanna offend Ohmar and Tlaib.
 ,Is it almost time that we start ignoring her?  Or do we have to do this to react to the Left praising her stupidity?
 ,well guys give her a break on one hand we had a distinct religious group and on the other EasTEr WoRSHiPErs...
 ,She is pro Islam and anti American working with globalists to deconstruct the USA.. of course she can't say anything. Even if she wanted to which I doubt she does her handlers would never allow it as the globalist plan is Muslim immigration influxes to displace white people and Christians.This vile racist woman must be stopped at all costs.
 ,It's so depressing seeing the reaction people have had to the Sri Lankan terror attack nearly 300 people died 300. It was clearly a collaborative attack on Christians. Yet compared to the Christchurch attack (which was just as abhorrent) the reaction has been near to nothing. I never wanted to go down this rabbit hole because I didn't want to believe it but I'm starting to see some truth about an assault on Christians whites and practically anything that symbolises the west and all its successes.
 ,CNN was literally on today blaming the Christchurch shooters for causing muslim retaliation in Sri Lanka. The hilarity and stupidity just keep one upping each other.
 ,That stupid bitch has to figure out if she agrees or not... here’s a clue.. NO
 ,They're not even trying to hide they don't care about the Christian vote. They want the Leftist and Islamist vote. Both hate Christians.
 ,Let's not overuse the "you didn't say anything this time" narrative. You have to let a person walk into that to pull the hypocrisy rigmarole. You don't go out of your way to point it out.I make remarks occasionally. I don't comment on a lot of other things. If everything I don't comment on is an aspersion on my character I'm truly screwed.
 ,Apparently Christian lives are just worth less. Islam won't skip on America. See you around the block Cortez. Sleeping with snakes... don't be surprised when you get bitten.
 ,she better not come out with an "Easter worshipper" Tweet
 ,There is not one single good explanation for this. And she’s not the only democrat who was screeching about muh White Nationalism for a month and then went radio silent when 321 people (including at least four Americans) were killed in Sri Lanka. The far left wing of the Democratic Party is cancer.
 ,>Ocasio-Cortez jumped into action only a couple hours after reports surfaced about the New Zealand terror attacks mocking people of faith in a tweet: "At 1st I thought of saying 'Imagine being told your house of faith isn’t safe anymore.' But I couldn’t say 'imagine.' Because of Charleston. Pittsburgh. Sutherland Springs. What good are your thoughts & prayers when they don’t even keep the pews safe?"How could the democrats defend this?
 ,it's only bad if the white devil does it.   all others are simply misunderstood.
 ,I can’t stand this bitch
 ,I really wish she was just dumb and pretty instead of dumb pretty and in office
 ,This chick is in way over her head. But of course she has 99 percent of the media to help her and not call out her nonsense. Was she even a good bartender?
 ,Enemy of the people
 ,Because that’s what the left do. They pretend to care about those in need but they only do it for their benefit alone. Just look at trump’s sanctuary cities. Before that they were calling trump a racist and appealing to immigrants to hopefully win their votes but as soon as the immigrants start actually affecting their way of life they’re either silent or campaigning against it not thanking trump for providing sanctuary to immigrants. I’m not surprised they haven’t referred it to the Nazi ghettos yet. I bet that they’ll eventually find some way to blame the Sri Lankan attack on white people probably blaming the coward who shot up a mosque in New Zealand for the attack (to be fair it was in retaliation) instead of tackling the real issue: radicalism.
 ,she’s a Horrible person!!
 ,Well of course. This attack isn't useful to her. She could use the NZ shooting to say that guns are bad and that Muslims are oppressed. This attack doesn't help her forward any of her narratives so she ignores it. It shows that she doesn't actually care about people or any of these attacks. She only cars about pushing her agenda.
 ,This is a good thing. Conservatives should want the left wing to say as much or as little as they want. Give them enough rope and they’ll eventually hang themselves. We’ve seen it time and time again. That’s why I stopped arguing with libs and just let them talk
 ,Its because she wants your guns. She isn't concerned about explosions.
 ,Occasional-Cortex has not been told what to say yet.  Give it a week or so.
 ,She fucked up...she could have gotten some sway by coming out against it and using the dreaded Christian word
 ,Are we really gonna trip if someone doesn’t say something? Not saying something isn’t the same as condoning it. Who cares this is the same argument media used for trump supporting white supremacy
 ,It's great that they're talking about this on /r/politics Oh sorry they're not.
 ,In before she just calls the Christians that died "Easter worshipers"
 ,She's influential and has to take the public/social responsibility of commenting on these events. It's almost as if people are gonna interpret this as an act of sympathizing with the terrorists indirectly.
 ,Am I the only one happy she just STFU?
 ,She can't blame white people or guns for this so obviously she's gonna stay quiet. It's disgusting how both sides remain silence when it doesn't fit their agenda
 ,I like to think she will smarten up one day and recognize that radical Islamicists are not our friends and there is good reason to shun them. One day.
 ,If at any point there is anything to grill this bitch over you can count the daily wire to do it. God I love Ben and his brand.
 ,Her handlers haven't told her how she feels about it yet.
 ,Giving anymore coverage to this woman only fuels the response from the other side.  Ignore her arrogance and agenda then defeat her on the floor of the Senate with votes.
 ,It's SAD to know that such devastating events are being politicized by individuals for personal and political gains.
 ,Of course she is silent. Demo's praise Islam as being tbe religion of peace but I still have yet to see suicide bombers from other religious groups.

 ,Because I am not "trump" lol  he does things I like  just because he is a raging ass that says dumb shit has no bearing on him doing what I want politically. Why are they so childish
 ,Let's  see Green new deal after birth abortions OBVIOUS petty attempts at garnering votes ( reparations) illegal immigration being ok and a false narrative on a duly elected president being a Russian spy...I miss ANYTHING?
 ,Not a fan of Trump but I'm more not a fan of you.
 ,Lady you don't know *dick.*
 ,The furries have infiltrated the police
 ,This is a libertarian argument as much as it is a conservative one. Only a socialised police force can breed about this much inefficiency and not be penalised for it by free market competition.
 ,Just makes me appreciate absolutely kicking the shit out of them back in 1783 AND 1815.
 ,Oh and going after internet bullying
 ,Just what the fuck.
 ,Once upon a time the sun never set on the British Empire. Now it's perpetual midnight. Sad.
 ,Fact: Women commit DV more often than men it’s just when men commit DV the intensity is much greater. IOW: Women send you to the ER to get stitches men send you to the morgue.
 ,Remember this is also a country where we have no legal right to own firearms. The cops are too busy with this nonsense instead of combating crime whilst at the same time citizens have no practical and legal means to defend themselves and their families from criminals. Are liberty and justice dead in the UK?
 ,bad guy: I had this master plan enslave all these people but I was thwarted because those damn cops painted their fingernails. How did the cops find out that painting their fingernails prevents me from enslaving people for some reason?
 ,These guys basically ruled the world at one point. Lol
 ,Don't worry. They'll drop all this nonsense the instant someone says something mean on twitter or someone reports an unlicensed buttering of toast seen through a window.
 ,The UK is gone.
 ,i'm glad this isn't in the US.  if we had the soaring violent crime rates like the UK does and *this* is how the police are reacting i hope there would be a massive uproar for them to get their shit together.
 ,🤡🌏
 ,Can somebody explain me what in the fuck happened to the UK? I'm serious it used to be a nice country
 ,lol what a bunch of losers.
 ,Wow. They're not cops these creatures are degenerate furries!
 ,Last one out of Britain turn off the light
 ,Its good to see they have their priorities in order.
 ,Welcome to Clown World take a seat and enjoy the view.
 ,London has fallen
 ,this is what i call the culture of obama...all show and publicity with zero results...but the masses never notice the last part of no results they are too focused on the fireworks show
 ,Does anyone have the name of the site this was taken from?
 ,People are more afraid of upsetting wrongdoers than stopping them. This does not just apply to police. A lot of people have lost the will to fight.
 ,A clown police force for a clown world UK.

 ,I used to do door to door sales. Much to my chagrin some people don't like door to door salesmen (shocking! I know). I saw quite a few guns during my time in that job.If I were casing the house as many homeowners often suspected I would not recommend trying to rob it because there's a competent person with a firearm in the house.This isn't that complicated. Good people with guns stop bad people.. Or at least dissuade themedit: that's why a guy who had a colt pointed at me was buying what I was selling 10 minutes later. Good people
 ,The UK is lost.
 ,I get the sentiment but let's not pretend like these guys are ignoring screams for help while wearing high heels.Much of their ineffectiveness is due to policy rather than inaction.
 ,Hey now. Some border patrol agents are fighting to keep the same political borders of Northern Ireland and that is honorable.
 ,What the.
 ,There's a show from the UK that keeps popping up on my YouTube recommendations called "Don't Pay? We'll Take It Away." It's basically about court-appointed collection agents going into houses and business and issuing ultimatums about court judgments or other debts levied against them. At least once an episode someone will start getting rowdy and physically harass the officers who will then call the police... and it'll take 45 minutes for the police to show up.I honestly don't know how the UK hasn't become utterly lawless by now.
 ,RIP Britain.  You were once Great but no longer....
 ,If I'm being honest it seems like they are just putting there faces out with decent PR. I don't really think that seeing an officer or two being light-hearted is affecting our crime rates...

 ,I remember when the Chick-Fil-A boycotts began. I also remember being in line that overflowed into a street waiting to order a chicken sandwich. Believe it or not Chick-Fil-A did not offend my political views nor hurt my feelings I showed my support to a company that produced a quality product and exceeds personal expectations regarding customer service. So what if Amazon publicly donates money to LGBT(Q*) causes? So what if Proctor & Gamble supposedly donate money to the Church of Satan? If we were to boycott everyone we didn't agree with on a personal level we'd be without friends goods and services while bitching about the lack of. This manufactured outrage and victimhood is something we must walk away from and just enjoy our fucking lives
 ,Good luck with that.
 ,Boycott boycotts!
 ,These people get paid to play dress up and pretend to be other people.   I simply do not care what you have to say or think just because you’re on a screen. And people who put all this hype around them just blow my mind
 ,Anything that is NOT an absolute statement of support and solidarity with the Left is to be taken as an alt-right attack now?I hope Marvel is happy with their choice in actresses 'cause this one seems to bring more trouble than she's worth.
 ,No doubt Renner will get shit for how “uninterested” he looks
 ,The internet ablaze? You mean a few incel and alt-right sites and a handful of YouTube channels all of which will be ignored like everything else the butthurt have tried and failed at the last couple of months?
 ,"Some people did something. At this point what difference does it make?" -probably.
 ,Our old friend Cenk will love this.
 ,"The lawmaker said as the 2020 election approached he believed the country will pay a “heavy price for Trump’s reckless spending and shortsighted financial policies.” So he joins the party which seeks to spend trillions on socialist boondoggles...yeah...that makes perfect sense.
 ,*Oh no what will we do...*
 ,Don’t let the screen door hit you on the way out...
 ,So because of Trump this guy has decided to flip flop on his stances on abortion gun rights fiscal policy immigration etc?The real question here is does this guy actually believe in anything he says or votes on
 ,So he was already a democrat he's just making it official.
 ,Well that cover just gave me nightmares
 ,50 shades of retardation
 ,In before someone trolls "it's not communism it's socialism!"Socialism is when the workers seize the means of production. Communism is when the government does it.  Since there aren't any real *workers* in their movement the government has to manage things.History of course is replete with examples of how that didn't go wrong at all.
 ,Caan't breathe...cannnnn't stoppp....laughinnnnggggg!

 ,Delete this\-Planned Parenthood
 ,My mom had this with my older brother and kidney cancer.  He is married and has 2 kids 34 years later.  My mom is still doing good as well.
 ,I’m glad she had the right to make whatever decision she wanted and that it’s not illegal to keep a pregnancy when you have cancer. Awesome they’re happy.
 ,This is a great story but do not treat this as a blueprint everyone should follow. The mother is ALWAYS more important to save if it's a one or the other type situation. If the mother makes the choice to lay down her life to protect the childs for moral or religious reasons then god bless that woman but I hope the Father is present with the suport and means necessary to care for the child. If not the father then hopefully family or friends of the mother. When a pregnant mother is sick it is not black and white. It is all gray and hard to navigate to find the right decision. If a doctor says to a to-be mother she needs treatment before the child can be delivered and if she doesn't there is a 25% chance of her dieing who are we to tell the mother she must take that risk? Facing sickness and the worst possible scenario for her baby is a tragedy. One that wont be made lightly. The health and life of the mother is so important for a child. Let the family decide whats right for them. Its not a meaningless murder because it's inconvenient at the time. It's a life-altering decision that should be respected.
 ,May God bless them
 ,Not always the case.. my niece had a good prognosis with her cancer treatments until she got pregnant. She knew what she was doing when she stopped the cancer treatments. During pregnancy the cancer spread to her bones and she died when her baby was 2.  We respect the hell out of her decision it was her life but we sure miss her
 ,That is awesome
 ,"Immediately she rejected the idea of aborting her unborn daughter saying “I knew I would rather die and give birth.”"Immediately got me teary-eyed. What a sacrifice of love. God does move and work miracles. That being said as a pro-lifer I would not blame a mother in this situation for choosing the abortion. It is a tragic gray area that had a mercifully happy ending here.
 ,ALL abortions are murder.  Mothers who get abortions deserve the same fate.
 ,Well With India and China holding down 75% of the world's pollution I can't really see this going anywhere.
 ,If we've only got 12 years left I'm going to eat whatever the hell I want.
 ,LOL.  The mayor of the financial capital of the world is a fucking moron.  It will be fun to watch all the NYC idiots as the "things that they like" are eventually cut back or ended.  They never realize that all the idiots that believe in the global warming hoax are going down a slippery slope.

 ,I picture De Blasio and Gore at a sleepover having a pillow fight and giggling uncontrollably.
 ,Say what you want about Walsh the man can write a headline.
 ,That was a extremely well written piece.
 ,Since Democrats seem to value style and celebrities over substance I think I have an idea we can all get behind. Wouldn’t it be great to see people from “The Office” run for the Democratic ticket.   I sure miss that show and it would be good to see them again.   Also they are (especially in character) as qualified as any of the current Democratic candidates but they would be so much more entertaining.  The Democrats would probably love it too since they would have the celebrities they crave and access to the  wisdom of their idols.   It wouldn’t hurt the current field of candidates since there’s so many of them anyway it would be good to at least recognize someone in their array of candidates. Imagine Jim as POTUS and Angela as Commerce Secretary.    Good times!!    Imagine the great scenarios that can come from this.
 ,Hide all of the garbage subs always remember to tell yourself that this place isn't reflective of reality more than a skewed collection of younger people high school and college students and non-Americans who either have no idea how this place works or have yet to truly experience and rationalize life. Try to be patient and remember that if you're right the reasonable will notice and truth will win even if you're getting downvoted to hell by the ideologues and dogmatics. And if you're wrong maybe you'll learn something and become that more effective and well-rounded.Even if I'm arguing with a radical I try to speak like moderates are listening and taking notes on the sidelines. Sometimes it ends up being trollfare and that's fine too it's the internet.
 ,I just... don't. It's not worth the stress anymore. I try to ignore the things I don't agree with.

George and Teddy had 4 opening acts -- one of which was a tall brunette in long slinky clothes and her pal in a bear skin vest.NOBODY had ever heard of them Sonny went on to be mayor of Palm Springs then a Congressman before he died in a skiing accident.

 ,Well duh? Omar represents her district of terrorists very well. That's what she was elected to do after all.
 ,The dnc is a extremist group
 ,Anxiously waiting for the day she gets sentenced for treason.
 ,I also wonder if she believes 9/11 was done by Al Qaeda."Some people did something" is so bland that she could believe that Bush or Israel is responsible.

 ,you know crazy stuff like that only happens when times are good. the liberal base accepts her because they dont really have any worries in their life and they think a muslim anti-semitic anti-american Rep. is a nice opportunity to troll conservatives. just wait until times get worse and people have actual worries again. the leftists who want their good lifes back with their iphones and starbucks coffee and all that will be the first ones who will cry for true patriots to protect them against the orcish invasion...

 ,Literally had to pay private doctors and hospitals to do the work.  VA is proof positive socialized healthcare can't work.
 ,I got bad news for everyone:  The VA still blows.  I called Trump's VA hotline they got people from my local VA to call me I asked that I be sent out for care since the clinic couldn't see me for a bit.  They told me "Well that clinic has to put in the request for you to be sent out."  Call that clinic back they not only say they don't want to but they don't even know how to.You'd have to burn the entire system down for it to improve.  Trump would have to be President for 4 or 5 terms and fire everyone working in management for anything to improve.  I don't  think many of you have any idea how badly entrenched the filth is at the VA.
 ,If Trump fixed it it ain't broken!
 ,Were here to repeal and replace.
 ,So sad we can't use this woman's name to post.  Even her name is a Democrat killing word.
 ,I need some context Pedes
 ,Ha now she has to decide if she wants to side with him on this or change her thought
 ,Dems are so obsessed with AOC’s crazy eyes and hooker lipstick that they don’t realize she’s a complete dingbat.
 ,Yeah no.
 ,AOC: " I was talking about the Veterinarian Association"....you know the docs that take care of the bow wows and meow meows."
 ,the only way a post regarding the bitch doesn't get shadowed on this DOMreddit!!
 ,Breadline Bernie was chairman of the Senate committee on Veteran's Affairs.  What did he to to fix the VA?
 ,my dad can attest that the va is pure dog shit
 ,Oh my god our president is the greatest troll in the world.
 ,4d chesssssss
 ,oh no he mentioned her. FUCK why?????
 ,I don’t think he should have went to go as far as to say it isn’t broken I’m sure he’s making strides to fix it but it’s still broken.
 ,Congrats AOC you've been acknowledged on GEOTUS Twitter! Welcome to the big leagues 😏
 ,The VA sucks and anyone asking for the govt to run our healthcare industry is an idiot.  Its no coincidence that the Europeans are cowed into allowing mass immigration and why callimg someone 'racist' is so powerful over there.
 ,The VA is garbage. The VA should be a healthcare REFERRAL service not a provider.
 ,Even a broken clock is right once a day.
 ,It was very nice of her to point this out even though shes to dumb to know what she did
 ,Thanks Alexandria. Very cool.
 ,The VA is 1000% more responsive to veterans these days (including private health augmentation) it really is a sea change in attitude under President Trump's administration.
 ,"President Trump deserves ~~a lot of~~all of the credit."
 ,Wellif the VA ain't broke it sure as shit was not anything AOC did.
 ,As a veteran I second this. The VA is different now than it was in 2016
 ,She’s always stepping in it. Bless her dumb ass!
 ,How do we have three veteran suicides inside the VA in 5 days and a couple weeks later say the VA is doing great?
 ,Yup!!
 ,Lol AOC will be SEETHING after reading this...
 ,I'd still prefer it if the loosened the requirements to buy into tricare for vets. Would generate resources for the system too
 ,I couldn't believe how many FOX pundits followed this story---trying to prove AOC wrong--"But it IS broken blah blah blah" . They took her bait.  POTUS IS right--he's done/is doing more for the VA than any other administration!
 ,Not just a brain surgeon...a pediatric and neonatal brain surgeon. He has successfully performed brain surgery on babies still in the WOMB! He is a genius and a savior of babies.

 ,I love sleepy doc.  Remember when trump hung out with him backstage at the debate because he didn't get his name called?  That moment forged a great relationship.Asshole Jeb just pushes them out of the way.

 ,If you have a library near you If you can readAnd you can think you can educate yourself
 ,I pass by the school in Detroit he's named after on my way to the Eastern Market all the time. It's a goddamn shame the city wants to rename it.
 ,Ben Carson is concrete proof the American dream is live and well. You can grow up with a single mother that can't read become the best pediatric brain surgeon in the world and go on to help the President Make America Great Again. I'm sure it was just all his white privilege thoughWonder what his favorite book is? He would be a great candidate for an AMA.
 ,So reading books is better than selling drugs?
 ,He looks like such a kind person.
 ,This is what a leader looks like.Success doesn't depend on what color you are on the outside success depends on what is on the inside of a person.
 ,Success is 1% inspiration and 99%perspiration. Success is colourblind but it sees effort and willpower. Work maketh the man.
 ,Big awesome 👌🏻
 ,Now this is MAGA.  No excuses full speed ahead.  Now he is cleaning up a federal agency that has been a bastion of corruption for ages.
 ,Look up his interview when he talks about democrats threatening to bring an illegitimate child of his to the press. As he says he laughed at them(the only woman he ever had sex with was his wife) and said if they had a real kid he would love to meet up.
 ,Not only a Neurosurgeon but one who pioneered new procedures and research.
 ,The power of not believing you are a victim. And things were 100x worse for blacks when Carson was a boy.That is the most corrosive part of leftism telling little children they cannot achieve greatness on their own because of institutional racism or sexism. The message should be yeah there are racists but don't waste your time on them just strive for excellence look at all the success stories. No I can't. Just how do I?
 ,Fine looking scholar no homo
 ,...I think sleepy doctor is an attractive man...
 ,He even has a great movie about his life called [Gifted Hands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifted_Hands:_The_Ben_Carson_Story). I highly recommend everyone see it.
 ,Dr. Carson said that his mother used to make her children write book reports.  She pretended to read the reports.  He never realized that his mother was illiterate until he was an adult.It shows that good parenting is in the relationship and structure not in the amount of resources.  God Bless Mrs. Carson!
 ,Remember kids.Having fun isn't hard when you've got a library card!
 ,These are the characteristics one should look up to not those of the jesters dancing for us in hollywood and media.
 ,As the UNCF would say "a mind is a terrible thing to waste"
 ,We have so much respect for Dr. Carson we are blessed to have him serve in Trump's administration 💖
 ,[removed]
 ,But muh oppression!
 ,Good dude right there.
 ,I've gotten as far in life as I have for similar reasons.  We were broke but my mother chose to emphasize education over falling into the traps of the neighborhood I grew up in.  Some of my fondest most peaceful memories of my youth are from my local library and I can still remember the sounds of my footsteps echoing in one of the vaulted chambers.  That reminds me I need to make a donation to them soon.
 ,It's always weird to remember that sleepy Ben is actually like one of the world's best surgeons.
 ,Did somebody give him 'white privilege' or something? I was told WP is the determining factor wether or not someone will succeed in this country.
 ,*“As a pioneer in neurosurgery Carson's achievements include performing the only successful separation of conjoined twins joined at the back of the head; performing the first completely successful separation of type-2 vertical craniopagus twins; developing new methods to treat brain-stem tumors; and reviving hemispherectomy techniques for controlling seizures. He became the youngest chief of pediatric neurosurgery in the country at age 33. He has received more than 60 honorary doctorate degrees dozens of national merit citations and written over 100 neurosurgical publications. In 2008 he was bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom the highest civilian award in the United States.”*https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_CarsonStable genius.
 ,I love those tough mothers.  And she probably insisted he speak intelligently too.
 ,Is this how the phrase "Exception that proves the rule" works.I always took it to mean that if it wasn't unique you wouldn't be able to point it out.  So the fact that it stands out shows that the rule holds?
 ,Ben Carson is an American success story.  He is an inspiration not just to those who grew up in poverty but to everyone regardless of circumstance.  The USA may be the first and only country where this kind of success is possible.The Left is afraid of Ben Carson.  He shows that impoverished people can pull THEMSELVES up and do not need to be dependent on the government.  They try their hardest to label him a moron and I hope Americans can see through it.Thanks for sharing this!
 ,b-but libraries are racist!
 ,If only he had some opportunity in life....gosh.
 ,I have enormous amount of respect for Dr. Carson.
 ,I really recommend his book "Gifted Hands" he's amazing.
 ,This is what I do to my kids. Also include math. My six year old does multiplication fractions and division. He is also raised weary of people who tell him what he should think about things
 ,Look at my African American over there look at him! Isn't he amazing!
 ,Trump is way better though
 ,Never underestimate the power of opportunity and education. Wish all mothers were like Sonya.
 ,Thanks to those damn socialist public libraries!
 ,The library is a great system.
 ,No foreigners needed. American minds are the best
 ,#The best things in life are free#Support your local library#Visit the ocean
 ,And to think the democrats just want to throw more money at education; Howabout we sit down with our kids and make them read books. &#x200B;Worked for him!
 ,Why does it have to be an American mind
 ,NO FUCK YOU GUYS! SOCIALISM IS THE ANSWER!
 ,Why is this wholesome story being used to support an asshat that has nothing to do with him?
 ,Libraries are socialist and need to be abolished.  The free market can do better.  IDK why my tax dollars are going towards educating poor blacks when I have poor white kids of my own to educate.  My Carson is a good man and all but public libraries are SOCIALIST.
 ,And yet you people are against the very taxes that kept that library open.
 ,Libraries are socialist. To this propaganda I say No Thank You!
 ,Yet the only black success story they teach children is the peanut man GWC. Everything else is repression and the evil white man.
 ,Love the movie btw.
 ,Most urban mothers let rap lyrics raise their children these days. Sad.
 ,Donald Trump was born on third base and acts like he hit a triple
 ,But I thought rags to riches was impossible?
 ,God bless Ben. He and his upbringing are a model for us all.
 ,Damn! That's tiger mom level of mothering.
 ,Hell yeah!
 ,If you share my values you are the same as me. Reading is liberating everyone should pick up a book now and again.
 ,Social justice memes are the worst - is anything on this meme true?2 books a week?Married at 13?Is that even Ben Carson?
 ,I’m confused hoe someone can read two books a week normally takes me a few to get through a good book even reading 50 pages a day
 ,Ben Carson is exactly the type of person the left would want to abort. The child of a single black mother in poverty with other children already. Don't let the left stop the Ben Carson's of the world from living life.
 ,Why does the left hate the idea of people becoming something better than they currently are with such a passion?
 ,Yeah but he's a Christian sooooo... checkmate drumph
 ,Wow. That's actually amazing.
 ,Derp! He’s an exception! Under the right lighting he looks white that’s why he escaped institutionalized racism! DERP!!!
 ,Never underestimate the power of an American Mother.
 ,This is so true... you cannot *make* anyone into a success; they have to do it themselves. You can make opportunities available you can support all of the self-help initiatives you want to; but you can never educate someone into success they do not want or are not willing to work towards.
 ,Victor mentality!
 ,I wanted Ben Carson to win the primaries tbh. But I can wait for 2024
 ,That's beautiful.
 ,Didn't hurt that a rich guy gave him a leg up to help pay for college.
 ,Who should have been the first black president
 ,the left:  hEs A nAZi!!!1
 ,Don't underestimate the library card either.
 ,God damn I love this country
 ,Proof positive that your history does not determine your future.  As Americans we have the wonderful opportunity to achieve above our "cast" something many many nations do not permit.Democrats are dying to falling over themselves to force a cast system on this nation that says "if you are black you are in the black cast and your opportunity and outcome is dictated by that".  They don't want your success to be yours to enjoy they don't want you to risk failure - they just want drones.Republicans believe that an individual is allowed to succeed or fail on his or her own merits and should enjoy the fruits of their success or take responsibility for their failures.There's an army of degenerates angry millennial losers baby murderers and other criminals that deeply believe that they can never succeed.  They have been convinced deep down that the American Dream is a lie and their chances at a good life are dead.  MSM reinforces this nihilistic worldview too.  The only option that they believe is "taking" what they want that means stealing or voting in politicians that will legalize theft on their behalf.
 ,A black man that didn't follow the victimism script became successful and on top of that is a man of faith.I bet many on the left hate him more than anything else.
 ,The way the left treats Ben Carson disgusts me. All they see is a black republican. This man should be a pioneer for the black community. What the power of learning can unlock. No matter your lot in life. Nope. Hes ridiculed & insulted on the constant.
 ,I had a job in a High School for a while where I chatted with a teacher regularly at lunch usually about Game of Thrones.  Got pretty turned off when he admitted to me that he tells his minority students they don't have a chance 'cause the system is rigged against them and hard work is just a waste of their effort.&#x200B;Then you look at Ben Carson.  Many people are alive today I wager because he wasn't infected with that message.
 ,thats crazy. ben carson treated me for my concussion when i was 5.. i dont remember him but my parents say he was very nice and informative
 ,Of course he is ignored and detested.. same as how they treat Clarence Thomas.
 ,Train your mind first. Then your body.  Express positivity to others and do not seek any in return. Live this habitually.

 ,Also don’t forget his brother is an aerospace engineer
 ,And liberals will claim he is oppressive because he is successful. Such a shame.
 ,It is important to include another aspect of Ben Carson's life the deep faith he learned from his mother as well as a work eithic.  I finished his biography recently and it blew my mind
 ,A successful black person smiling... Twitter would flag this as sensitive content.
 ,I love capitalism
 ,Can we all take a moment to question why his mother got married at 13?  Excuse me wtf.
 ,This is the differnce between those who have the victim mentality and those who have the American spirit .
 ,Parents take note.
 ,Brilliant man
 ,This is why America stays winning!
 ,13?
 ,no no no.................. this is supposed to be bho's story!
 ,Props to Sonya Carson. (:
 ,Hope he runs for president one day!
 ,Democrats want to keep African-Americans poor and stupid. It’s been their motto for centuries. They don’t want AA’s to think for themselves or become successful because then they will realize that Republicans have the best interests for all Americans.
 ,That's one Handsome Graduate 👨‍🎓

 ,You can tell he has a kind Christian heart.
 ,The crazy thing is that Liberals hate everything about Ben Carson. 🤦‍♀️ 🤦‍♂️
 ,I really hope Carson runs again when Trump is done in 2024. He is a great man who has spent his entire life trying to help people and I’m sure he would do great things for this country. The left would have a very hard time trying to make him look bad.

 ,Not just a brain surgeon. One of the best brain surgeons in America of his day.
 ,Dr. Carson is an incredible success story and he is an incredible doctor.  He was absolutely right when he said we need more people from different walks if life to run the government and not just lawyers. His biggest weakness (if you want to call it that) during his campaign run was that he was just too nice of a person.
 ,This is exactly the kind of bigoted content I'd expect from this White Supremacist sub.
 ,Damn I hate hearing all this about the parents in rags to riches story. If you’re going to say “raised in poverty by an illiterate mother with only a third grade education” at least throw in a “who loved him more than life”. Some adult figure had to teach him just how to be even though most of it was on his own.
 ,I mean IQ is like 75-80% hereditary but this is still a nice story

 ,Hint: Dems in congress won't act now.
 ,Just shut the border down we have a 900 billion dollar a year military and somehow can't keep people from just walking over? We need to stop acting gullible dems want you and your family replaced by the third world while you pay for it. It basically slavery but this time its the fear of being deported that will make them loyal dem voters. When you have a captured voting base (See African Americans) you're not accountable to anyone and things turn to shit (See Detroit Baltimore Chicago Every Californian city etc)&#x200B;NOTHING ELSE MATTERS TILL WE STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
 ,But have they sent 418000 illegals back across the border?
 ,“Half a million!? Pfft that’s not a crisis... call me when it’s serious”-Every Cucked Leftist Ever
 ,>418000 plus illegal immigrantsWOW.Seriously. I had no idea it was this bad. Almost half a million people apprehended in less than months and the MSM and dems act like it's no big deal and that even *mentioning* it is racist. This is madness.
 ,Too bad that they just get released in the USA due to congresses laws.
 ,How many of those got released into the country though?
 ,They are acting Mr. President. This is their plan. Flood the nation with non-citizens that they will allow to vote.Arrest every single mayor city council member governor and member of Congress that advocate for this lawlessness and open borders. They are in violation of their oaths of office. Federalize their districts until we get this under control. They are direct threats to our nation. They are subverting our laws. This must end.
 ,Mexico cant cooporate. They are controlled by the cartels.
 ,[removed]
 ,And by "apprehended" he means released into our country thanks to our ridiculous immigration laws.  National crisis!
 ,We love you Mr. President!
 ,Apprehended means escorted to the nearest community receiving center.
 ,Doesnt mean shit if we are just gonna release them right after.
 ,The real question is what is done AFTER those illegals are apprehended.Sadly many are released or given some kinda joke hearings instead of being just thrown out of the country.
 ,...But once they're apprehended they're still just released into the country...
 ,I would be happier about this number if they weren't just being brought into the US and set loose after 3 weeks.
 ,So that's another half-million illegal aliens released into the USA. Not good at all.
 ,So blessed to have this guy president.
 ,Trump really tried so hard for the American people.
 ,Trump has done everything he can. 9th circuit keeps screwing with exec orders.
 ,Just shut down the border Mr. President. Mexico will never cooperate unless US Dollars stop flowing into their country.
 ,APPREHENDED cloing in on half a million and we're only about 1/3 through the year.  Now think about how many they weren't able to apprehend.  WTF???How can anyone not call this a crisis?Plus of course even those apprehended aren't being immediately sent packing which is how it should be.
 ,It just seems so sensible. Why Dems in Congress are allowed to twist these kinds of statements into some kind of racist hatred of brown people is beyond me.  That's HALF A MILLION illegal immigrants! No civilized country should ever tolerate that
 ,Stop money from going to Mexico. Shut the border down. Mexico is mocking us!
 ,Democrats are complicit in treason.
 ,418K but democrats said there is no crisis??? 🤪
 ,BUILD.
 ,That's almost as many illegal immigrants as the population of Wyoming. Imagine an entire state getting deported.
 ,Why is APPREHENDED in caps? Oh...
 ,The DemonkkkRats sponsored invasion of America should have stopped in 2016. America's future is not going to be American. It will be a future shithole if we keep importing shithole cultures.
 ,> ~~DEMS~~ OBSTRUCTIONISTS IN CONGRESS MUST ~~ACT NOW~~ STOP WORKING AGAINST AMERICA!
 ,So a group larger than the entire population of New Orleans was apprehended this year alone? How anyone could think this is A OK is beyond me.
 ,thats approaching the entire population of Wyoming the least populated state in the Union.Half a million people is a insane number.
 ,Holy fuckThat's more than the population of most nonmajor cities.
 ,But we still release thousands of illegals onto our streets every day..
 ,I want to know how many of those were released inside the US. That number should be 0 but for some reason it's not.
 ,¡Si yo comprendo!
 ,Need to pump those numbers up!
 ,Send them to San Francisco
 ,Why would they want to stop something that increases their power?

 ,Illegal aliens
 ,Dems will NOT act quit saying it!!! Punish Mexico immediately!!!
 ,Question. I'be looked some but all I can get are apprehension numbers.What are the estimates of those NOT apprehended that get through. What is the rough total attempting to illegally enter?
 ,Maybe Pelosi was hoping to house all 418000 in her mansions because they are all such good doctors and not criminals whatsoever.
 ,So far this year. Wtf. And I'd imagine they probably miss about half of then. During the last recession a lot of them went back.
 ,The only thing Dems care about is imaginary kids in cages because it means they don't have to do anything about it but it still feeds their supporters blind hatred for Trump.
 ,Sessions is building a case
 ,I love how he's telling them how to succeed but they won't do anything because of their TDS.
 ,They aren't going to stop their illegal voters
 ,Our border patrol agents are heroes! Thank you for supporting them every step of the way Mr. President!
 ,Once a secure southern border is established it could make a potential war on Mexican corruption and cartels easier for our military and safer for our civilians.
 ,A coup? All of our military supports Trump! That's never going to happen.

 ,Is part of the liberal illness having no self-awareness?  Do they know how ridiculous they sound?How is defending yourself against the most vile false allegations obstructing justice?  It is obstructing injustice.  Let them carry on digging and digging.  It all fuels Trump’s 2020 campaign.
 ,They keep questioning Trumps sanity while putting AOC in the limelight and that’s supposed to trigger a coup? Sure.
 ,Couldn't be more perfect.
 ,Obstruction requires you to impede due justice. The due justice here was a "no collusion" result from the Special Counsel and POTUS knew the truth the whole time! He got people out of the way who were actively sabotaging the truth. So actually. ACCELERATION OF JUSTICE.

 ,Funny.  I object when the state (government) attempts to hinder ones ability to state or prove their innocence.  Same with the gag order for R. Stone.   Trump was trying to stop a fraudulent investigation which seems more like trying to achieve justice than obstruct it.   It should not be a crime to stop a crime.

 ,The Dems are traitors. Not just the politicians either. Every single person throughout the US who still supports and votes for Dems today is complicit with them. Whether it's a conscious decision or not they hate everything we believe in and are doing their best to see we're outnumbered by the illegals and undeserving to ensure the GOP will never have a political voice again and that they can institute a de facto socialist dictatorship that is the exact opposite of what our founding fathers intended.Traitors. This needs to be emphasized more. We need to reframe how we view all the people who support Dems.

 ,I’m against drug abuse as much as the next guy especially the opiates. That being said my own neurochemisty is my god given sovereign territory and I’ll be damned if I ever acquiese to another individual or a government for that matter the ability to tell me when how and with what substances I can operate my brain. As long as I’m not operating machinery nor engaging in actions that may put any undue constraint or damage upon my neighbors keep your governance out of my brain and out my business.
 ,I love this president — **SO MUCH.**
 ,That was a damn good speech. He obviously wants to help all Americans and if you want a red pill for someone show them the speech he just gave.
 ,If the Republican party ran on the platform that they would federally unschedule marijuana under the banner of states rights we would drive a stake through the heart of the Democrat party. no one except boomers cares about the war on drugs.

 ,I’ve lost two cousins to drugs both were young when they died. Both started with opioids for injuries; one was a vet.

 ,HARD DRUG FREE AMERICA*****
 ,It'll never happen. Humans have been experimenting with drugs since they were discovered and they're not going to stop nor should they. The government should simply quit classifying most of the chemicals they have scheduled as illicit drugs. I'm not saying people should be able to scoop up heroin whenever they please at the corner store but it's really unfair to jail people for possessing hallucinogens or Marijuana. They're not hurting anyone not even themselves. Until alcohol is prohibited it doesn't make sense to prohibit the vast majority of chemicals. It's pretty evident by now that alcohol is one of the most dangerous abused substances out there and no one seems to mind it being sold in every store across America. It's hypocritical and completely unjust to those who are behind bars right now but less harmful substances.
 ,"DRUG FREE AMERICA"--that better not include alcohol (a drug) or sex (a drug) otherwise I'm off the Trump Train.
 ,**Sad thing is:**   **Somewhere someone is shooting them up with drugs saying "TAKE THAT DRUMF"**
 ,As someone who has smoked weed crack meth done cocaine mushrooms everything pretty much except heroin I would say legalizing weed should be the first priority.  Shrooms need some study but also LSD and both show potential to help people with depression and other ailments.  Crack is directly correlated to Coke so if you deal with the coke you deal with the crack.  Meth unfortunately would be much harder to get rid of.  My 2 Cents.
 ,What is the planning ?
 ,Honestly this is probably his most dangerous tweet.  He is directly pushing back against drug manufacturers (and illegal drug trade sponsors) who have hands in a lot of pockets... maybe even more dangerous then exposing the FBI/CIA 0bama Justice department collusion and the deep state.  Many doctors have been killed in some very questionable circumstances for exposing Drug companies political ties and skewed "research" studies...God Bless our great Dr. President Trump!
 ,That should include marijuana fuck the bullshit. It's for losers.
 ,The president just accused the Mexican military of collaborating with drug traffickers.Cut diplomatic relations with Mexico they are a hostile power with no respect for US sovereignty.
 ,##**BETTER NOT HAPPEN AGAIN!**

 ,I was waiting for this. Fuck Mexico Now.
 ,Time to declare that Cartels are terrorist organizations.  Enough!!
 ,When a foreign army pulls weapons on American soldiers on American soil there should be only one response.
 ,Perhaps these were the drug smugglers the Mexican soldiers were causing a distraction for? https://youtu.be/-5-Pxjckacc
 ,Mexico is a failed state and is colluding with criminals and terrorists.  They've lost any ability to be our ally.  We need to close the ENTIRE MEXICAN border permanently.
 ,Not enough.  You need to change the ROE deploy in force and provide adequate coverage of forces via direct and indirect fires and a QRF.Mexico’s Army is shit.  Back in the day they sent an officer to my class at the Armor Officer Basic Course despite Mexico not having any tanks.  He was a nice guy but probably a little slow meaning slow in the way you describe your cousin’s kid with the helmet.

 ,Mexico is a nacro state its an example of what happens when you let organized crime reach catastrophic levels. When the cartels are better equipped than the military there and have bought out all levels of government what to you do? When someone attempt change they and their family disappear. Doesn't matter if they are a mayor or a head of state there.I vote wall up the entire border as the cartels in addition communicate and work with local gangs in the U.S [to attempt the same shit](https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2018/08/mariah_lopez_oralia_mendoza.html).

 ,Thank you for telling us President Trump! Thank you for being transparent and treating us like the intelligent adults we are.
 ,Why should soldiers have less gun rights than regular citizens.  They should be armed.  They are professionals.
 ,México is not a country and it does not have a government in the way we use those words. México is a loose federation of regions that have little or nothing to do with the modern geographic boundaries of the Mexican "states." The real divisions are much older derived from the royal land grants or "títulos de castillo" given by the Crown to the original nobles who got first dibs on land in the New World. These grants have been further divided down the years into haciendas and so forth but they have never left the family. The old money hacendado families rule and form factions among and against each other and these arrangements are constantly shifting. They also transcend national borders as the same families have holdings in multiple nations on the continent. This explains the coordination between all the "countries" on the migrant caravans. The Mexican President is whatever figurehead these families permit. The Legislature does their bidding. They own everything including all major businesses the cartels and the Army. This is how Latin America works. Latin American "countries" are not countries. They are feudal states like the old countries of pre-WWI Europe. So if Mexican army were at the border it is likely they were escorting narcos human traffickers smugglers or all three.
 ,https://youtu.be/s2zjg78ay4I.... is what we as Patriots should be saying...
 ,does anyone remember the trolls here who were saying that Mexico drawing weapons on US soldiers on US soil "was an accident" and that Mexico was "really really sorry" lol
 ,Close the fucking border. Deploy tanks Apaches and armed soldiers with live ammo.
 ,And we have troops in Europe. Makes no sense. Give US companies fair warning like May 5th and then shut down the border for a year with reassessment at that time.
 ,I’d rather fund a wall of shoulder-to-shoulder **marines** than the obstructionist losers in congress who refuse to fund border structures  and reform our dumb ass laws

 ,The Mexican army is working for the drug cartels. They got the drop on those Weekend Warriors and allowed a large drug shipment to make it into the US.
 ,If Mexico knows what's good for them they better get their shit straight.
 ,How bout Don nut up and close the fucking border already? I’m all for calling Mexico out on their bullshit but actions speak louder than words.
 ,He affects the world with his tweets.
 ,They pointed guns at our boys? That’s an act of war.
 ,This is a bigger deal than what the media is making it. The Mexicans just gave Trump a legit causus beli to militarize the border.(Edit: I hate incorrect)
 ,Idea. We conquer Mexico and build the wall at their southern borders. It would be a much smaller wall meaning we could make it much taller too.
 ,Article IV Section 4:    > The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government **and shall protect each of them against Invasion**...Texas was **invaded** by a foreign military which the US Government has the *duty* to repel.

 ,“Fuck around and find out” - president trump
 ,The mexican police and military along with most positions of power are bought and paid for by the cartels. Trump is right. Next time no surrender.
 ,Trump is finally saying what all of us have been thinking. Mexico doesn’t want none of this. We could fuck them up beyond recognition in minutes if we had to. If they want to avoid conflict with us they shouldn’t be aiding “refugees” with their invasion. Mexico needs us a lot more than we need them.
 ,#CLOSE THE FUCKING BORDER!!!!! How is this not a blatant act of war?Pressure from corporate America is the only reason the border is being left open American lives are being put at risk because of the rampant consumerism that has consumed this country. Fuck corporate America close the damn border. My vote for 2020 depends solely on concrete progress i.e. actual militarized border security to counter the literal invasion(like Israel) and mass deportations to reverse the demographic shift. If neither happen I refuse to vote.
 ,It was a deterrent to aid drug smugglers.
 ,Level the five closest Mexican 'military' installations to where that incident occurred. Lots of USAF units in the southwest need regular bombing practice.
 ,Fuck Mexico.
 ,Jesus in only a week we’ve seen a massive terrorist attack on Christians being white-washed to adhere to a narrative multiple democratic presidential nominees give full throated support for the Boston Marathon bomber regaining his voting rights and now Mexican cartels colliding with their military dictating our borders and national security.  This gets scarier every day.

 ,Is he actually sending soldiers? I hope so. How many and when? Let’s see some action
 ,FUCK MEXICOChange my mind
 ,The border should have been shut down years ago. Fuck Mexico. Reconquistadors can eat lead.
 ,I’m so glad he responded to this incident. I think he was just waiting til he had all the details. This can not happen again. I appreciate him tying up loose ends here before his UK trip.
 ,Its like Trump knows his presidency is a one time deal (though a 2 term endeavour) to correct a lot of things other presidents dare not touch even if they did support it privately. Even if he has to steamroll over topics. This is exactly what the ppl elected him to do. Not be a politician.  Work for America. Us.
 ,How many retarded leftists will fail to appreciate the gravity of what the President of These United States just told us? Probably all of them.
 ,I would've shot those Mexican soldiers dead if they tried to detain me ON MY OWN SOIL.  Let's have a fucking war.
 ,Since this happened 50 feet north of the Rio Grande I'm pretty sure even Mexican soliders know than the river is a border and where they were.This shit had better not happen again.
 ,I want to know what the ROE is.
 ,I mean common why would Mexico do anything. They are doing what they can to protect their own southern border but they don’t care much for their northern border. So we have to take it upon ourselves. Take armed forces on active military duty and station them on border.
 ,America is sending bigger guns down to the border to backup our already secured border.  Damnit Mexico we defended that border in past history and if you think for a moment that we won't continue to protect it.  THAT IS YOUR MISTAKE!!

 ,If US soldiers crossed the border into Mexico and forcibly disarmed their men at gunpoint the Liberal Lunatic Left (the LLL) would be having an absolute shit fit about it demanding they be prosecuted and tried on international war crimes charges.
 ,How exactly is this not an act of war?
 ,Why wouldn't military be armed in the first place? Do they think squirt guns will work against criminals?
 ,Based Mexican American war 2
 ,I'm not happy we are sending troops out in a position where they can be vulnerable. What happened to the standard American military doctrine of overwhelming force? Pull guns on our troops and we need to pull an apache on them.
 ,*Laughs in Texan*
 ,God I love our president more and more everyday.  This man is Teddy Roosevelt reincarnate
 ,Anyone got the details on what went down?Hearing that Mexican troops drew guns and disarmed two American soldiers?
 ,Who are these krassencucks and why do they always have the top reply to President Trump tweets?
 ,Every single branch of government every single faucet of government - from the police to the army to the politicians - are corrupt. This isn't news to either side the right or left. Mexico needs to get their shit straight or ask for help. Honestly I think the best thing for both Mexico and America would be for the US to "clean up" their country; and I don't say that lightly as someone opposed to almost every war the US has been in.
 ,**Cowabunga it is.**
 ,Mexico fuuuuuuuckin uuuuup AGAIN!!!When does the old fuck Bernando Sandero come into “leadership”¿?
 ,As soon as I scroll down on twitter I get instant "peach mints" 😂
 ,Fuck yes!!! I was hoping he would chime in here.
 ,This isn't the first time Mexico has done very shady shit like this.  I remember many years back they had Mexican military "accidentally" fly a helicopter illegally into American territory.
 ,Lock them up!!!
 ,Shut the border immediately.
 ,How to solve the problem:Build the wall (obviously)Patrol the entire border with drones armed with tear gas canisters parachute flares and of course lots of surveillance equipment. Arrest penalize deport anyone attempting to cross illegally. If they try again they will be subject to imprisonment. Don't trust the Mexican government to do anything about the problem because it isn't a problem for them.
 ,For every one soldier involved in this """incident""" fire a cruise missile at Mexico City. See if they pull this shit ever again.
 ,if they try to disarm our troops again - our troops should open fire. fuck that shit.
 ,Sounds like a Obama red line in the sand to me. Is the same Obama military commanders that allowed Iran to capture  our crying sailors and held them for ransom still running the show?
 ,"Mexicos soldiers" *cartel soldiers* Ftfy
 ,I’m loving how people in my fb feed are saying “there’s no proof!”  And then I get to paste a link to cnn a few days ago of an article describing Mexican soldiers detaining and disarming US soldiers on the US side of the border and watching them have to play immediate mental gymnastics
 ,Let's seize Baja California of they do it again.
 ,Annexico when?
 ,The missing on the branch.
 ,its always been so curious to me that people will cheer and applaud an investigation into Trump leaving no stone un-turned in order to discover the possible dealings between him and foreign actors when Hillary had an open air bribery scheme that operated for years that didnt even bother hiding its deep profound and nefarious connections to the very same foreign actors. Weird.
 ,Hillary is going down.

 ,Ben Garrison: Releases new comicMe: Find Hillary's shoe!
 ,Whenever you see Hillary sitting in a comfortable chair on some stage somewhere answering questions the fake news always says she was invited to talk at some bullshit whatever.  What they don't tell you is that her organization put together that entire bullshit whatever every question was written by her and the whole reason they staged that bullshit whatever was for her.  She pretends to be invited to things so it doesn't seem like she's hogging the attention.
 ,Whew I can smell her stench through my screen.
 ,"If Hillary is not held liable for her crimes then we know the Deep State remains firmly in charge and running the show."It is long past time for indictments charges and jail-time for Hillary and friends.

 ,Hillary IS the swamp!
 ,Hillary sometimes should just hush.She has many things that she should of been indicted on.But thankfully for her she had protection from the Obama's FBI/DOJ.
 ,Hello Mr. Garrison!Are you still banned from Instagram? (I don't use that garbage so I wouldn't know).
 ,Extra spicy!
 ,this might be one of my favorites
 ,Their projection is actually a smart tactic. By Hillary saying that “anyone else would have been indicted” she takes a criticism people were making of her and essentially neutralizes it. The Democrats know that all they need to do is say the same things their opponents are saying and it will all sound like nonsense to their base. “They are saying it but we are saying it too so I guess it’s a push.” Same reason they invented the Trump Foundation “scandal” when the Clinton Foundation was being exposed. Even when Brennan goes on TV for two years and says the President is a traitor it’s a smart move because he knows what he’s done and what people will say. They will say treason. So if he gets out in front of it and says it first he essentially neutralizes that attack. Now I don’t think it’s really going to work because the evidence will probably settle things but strategically it’s still Brennan’s best play.
 ,Thanks BG for including the shoe!

 ,Gotta be honest I don't really like Garrison's style. His comics might persuade some low information people to look into the various words he is using but they don't ever really strike me as funny persuasive or interesting. I can't help but compare him to Branco who puts out consistently funny political cartoons that I can't help but feel are ultimately much more persuasive.
 ,Obama colluded with foreign nations to influence our election.Change my mind
 ,#THE CENTIPEDE TAUNTS ITS PREY BEFORE STRIKING
 ,Trump has been pushing OANN a lot lately and has pointed out Fox News fuckery.  Follow his lead pedes.
 ,Five eyes and NATO members along with the Poroshenko regime were the real election meddlers
 ,I hope you all understand just how huge this tweet is. The Overton window continues to shift.
 ,He knows.  The real foreign interference was British.  Lousy Islamist traitors.
 ,They’re going to remain smug the same way before Trump won. When it all comes smashing into their faces and they are stunned and in disbelief.
 ,Trump knows. He knew the whole time. TRAITORS
 ,Damn this is a spicy tweet.
 ,Basically saying... Yeah you got the story right.
 , This is why POTUS should cancel his trip to Europe. Those people are worse than the house democrats.
 ,The momentum is building. I can't wait to watch these treasonous fuckers hang.
 ,June 23 2016What happened on that day?Brexit vote passed.That did two things:A) scared the shit out of the globalists that Trump could ride similar nationalism / populism to victory despite overwhelming opposition in the media and politicians from both partiesB) gave remainers in the British government a big incentive for Hillary to win. Crooked would have been able to easily force a second vote by withholding trade deals joint defense etc.It's also shortly after this date that all the Russia stuff kicked off in earnest no? I always thought Steele was just a lone wolf shill but now. Pretty sure "remainers" in the British governement were involved. At the very least they must have known what the Americans were up to.
 ,# ***FUCKING FINALLY***
 ,This is right on the heels of his trip to the UK. Dis gonna be good.
 ,I love that he is giving shoutouts to @oann now that foxnews is becoming a pile of trash.
 ,I wonder how difficult it's been for Trump to not talk about this since he found out about it probably over 2 years ago.  Interesting timing on him bringing up UK intelligence being involved the day after the state visit to the UK was announced...
 ,We need to ask ourselves why foreign actors were used. It was to inject the Russian collusion narrative into the official record: Downer makes an official statement which causes the Australian Embassy to contact the FBI. This launches (officially) Operation Crossfire Hurricane. Also the Steele Dossier (foreign intel) is used to get a FISA warrant.Why?Because spying was already being performed through NSA database searches and the info was being disseminated raw/unredacted for the purpose of gathering dirt and intel on political foes.Steele Mifsud Halper Downer Fusion GPS are all the cover story. Spying on their opponents had been going on for a long time. Adm Rogers shut it down and that's why you see them coming up with this stupid Russian collusion scheme: to hide their massive crime.
 ,#OH SHIT
 ,The Queen invited POTUS for an official visit June 3. I hope she gets an ear full.
 ,LaRouche was right! The British didn’t just help Obama — they initiated the coup attempt in late 2015 by “warning” Brennan about Trump’s ties to Russia.The Queen must apologize in person to Trump when he visits!
 ,Judge Napolitano is a cucklord
 ,The Democrats are all going to be squirming like freshly salted snails after this tweet
 ,"just a question of time before the truth comes out".  I'd like it to be today but I've waited patiently for years Mr. President and trust your sense of timing!
 ,If Bill O'Reilly and a few other people got together and started showing up on oan it would be awesome
 ,Glad to see VSGPOTUS watching OANN.
 ,We should sanction the UK and whoever else helped the same as we did Russia. The real interference was the UK and Australia

 ,Say it with me:  TREASON.
 ,UK 'pede here.To be fair to us Obama put us in an impossible situation. When your much more powerful 'ally' leans heavily on you to do him a solid what are you supposed to do?Do you think if we said no that we wouldn't have faced vengeful consequences from what everyone assumed was an incoming Clinton administration that would ally with the EU against our interests with Brexit on the horizon? That we wouldn't have been frozen out of crucial future intelligence sharing and trade deals?If you believe in America First you can't complain about the UK being put between a rock and a hard place and choosing Britain First. We did what we felt benefitted us the most when cornered. It's not like we independently chose to spy on Trump. We were asked/ordered/threatened to by a senior intelligence community partner.The real villain here is Obama. He directed it all.
 ,He fucking knows. He knows. I don't understand why they are slow rolling this information but I have to trust it's for a reason.
 ,A beauty!It's just a matter of time boys.
 ,I just have a feeling that Queen Elizabeth will die soon and the UK will have a new monarch. It's a hunch.
 ,We should leave NATO and form an alliance without the turks germans french or other flat out enemies in it. Allow the brits if they follow through on brexit otherwise who the fuck needs an ally that's just another slave state in the european caliphate? The betrayal of some of these places (looking at you australia) hurts but we don't need them militarily. At all. If they wont make the proper heads roll we should cut them off militarily and take steps to make them suffer economically.
 ,He knows. And soon you will too.
 ,Spin: UK is our greatest ally so no biggie. 🙄
 ,Here we go! He's telling them all to get ready
 ,If the left doesn't act out in a complete outrage this will be merely another example of their hypocrisy. We need to see them matching in the streets with pussy hats holding a fake Obama severed head and music videos of Obama getting shot...all before all the facts come out. It's only fair.
 ,And what did Crazy Uncle Joe know and when did he know it.  He was either part of it or an easily duped bystander.
 ,Funny how this slips into the news immediately after the UK visit is announced.Remember the President knows it all and is waiting for (and helping) the nation to catch up.  I'd like to be a fly on the wall for the meeting with May.Thank goodness for OANN and the Epoch Times.
 ,CBS news right now is telling me my vote doesn't count. If the democratic nominee doesn't win in 2020 it's because of Russia. Omg.
 ,He's pissed. Last time he was this pissed off he became President. Don't underestimate GEOTUS.
 ,This is why he is meeting with the Queen.
 ,It's pretty hilarious how he's known all this for 2 years but keeps letting the left hang themselves then he acts surprised
 ,He knows.
 ,Lol he's known the truth since 2015 that's why he ran.He's gonna work them all up into a frenzy then drop the MOAB of MOAB's.
 ,FOLKS.....  HE KNOWS!!!
 ,Those following Q have known this truth for at least a year. It's never too late to look and see the full terrible picture.
 ,I think this is assanges big secret; that british and german governments worked with Obama to sink Trump. Hate to use that over used word collusion...
 ,Hot
 ,Sanctions Mr. President?
 ,#A BEAUTY! !!!
 ,I shouldn't but when this all comes out I am going to enjoy rubbing this in the faces of everyone who said "Trump can't do anything they're all going to walk".
 ,I knew it would take years to drain the swamp. It is being drained.
 ,I haven't noticed a WOW tweet in a while.  This one is a doozy.
 ,#CNN: TRUMP PUSHES CONSPIRACY OF UK INTELLIGENCE SPYING ON HIS CAMPAIGN OFFERS NO PROOF.  #Politico: Here's why we shouldn't be concerned if UK was keeping an eye on Trump  #Huffpo: No Donald UK wasn't spying on you.
 ,What if he is holding all his cards until closer to the election before he blows the roof off this shit?
 ,But Q is totally a LARP amirite?
 ,Haha. Right before his visit to the U.K in June. Man is fearless.
 ,Holy shit he's calling out the queen!
 ,Wait is this why we have street cam video of James Comey and Lisa page taking a wintertime stroll together in London. That’s what they were doing! WTH!!!
 ,Trump is the master at getting under the skin of his opponents.He tweets this out the same morning he announces a trip to the UK.We need to pray for his safety while he is in the UK and France. Safety not from the people but from the governments.
 ,Bert and Ernie are going full retard in the replies. This is the truth and those fucktards know it.
 ,I've been to the Left to get the lowdown on this and apparently its just a crackpot conspiracy theory. Because y'know why would the POTUS know anything?
 ,Welp.  This is not what they wanted to get out.
 ,>it will be a beauty!# can't wait
 , The pot is beginning to boil over
 ,I love how like five years ago you could’ve posted to reddit about how the governments of the world utilize a method of having their respective spy agencies gather information on citizens of another country and willingly turn it over in return for information on their own citizenry. This could’ve been posted years ago without any personal political backlash and if anything the reddit community would be up in arms trying to make a whole thing of it. Now you see that they’ll die on that hill defending hopelessly their desire to not let Trump be correct and not let “the other side” have a victory. You can’t say the conservatives are much better since they play into this whole game as well but the left is genuinely disgusting and willing to burn us all down to prevent themselves looking like idiots.
 ,Gentleman. I believe it's safe to finally say IT'S HAPPENING!!
 ,**”If somebody hits you you've got to hit 'em back five times harder than they ever thought possible. You've got to get even.”**

 ,#Australia and Italy were involved too!
 ,Let's see they set up Papadopoulos in the UK and spied on him/Trump campaign even when he was on American soil to get around our laws-that would be my guess. Also the timing of the UK trip bet there will be some interesting meetings.
 ,Wow. That’s Krassen brothers. Imagine being popular for harassing the president. Maybe we can report them enough they get deleted.

 ,HMMMMM. This Larry Johnson used to have a blog called No Quarter where intrigue was occasionally discussed and that blog suddenly disappeared one day boom. I hadn't been following it so closely but remember that he was treading on toes--seems like there's another story here as he resurfaces.
 ,This can't be true.  Obama was scandal free.
 ,I didn’t realize he worked for the CIA after the NBA.
 ,I think I just heard Clinton crapping her diapers.
 ,>beauty!The previous president of the United States colluded with our allies in the UK to plot a coup d'état against his successor by deliberately and systematically lying to the judge of a special secret court designed only for spying on foreigners. This was done to prevent President Trump from learning and then revealing the vast web of other felonies committed by govt leaders in the CIA FBI and State Dept.BEAUTY!
 ,They never thought SHE would lose.
 ,Unfortunately even if somebody with name recognition and a (D) after their name is actually prosecuted the press is going to twist it and make it look like it’s simply Donald Trump attacking his political enemies rather than actual instigators of a soft coup being arrested and punished for their illegal transgressions.
 ,if only the Donald could be a bit more contained ...
 ,Lock her up!
 ,This just made my day!
 ,It's illegal under international law for a country to spy on its own citizens. That's why UK monitors USA and vice versa for all the other 5 eyes.That's why we have tons of fibre optics going from the UK too the USA
 ,George Papadopoulos talked a bit more about this in his interview on Fleccashttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb6em1zCg2A
 ,I have no issue exposing to the world who allied against the interests of the American people. They conspired to defraud our election process no less if not more so than Russia.
 ,So there is the foreign collusion
 ,Here's hoping the hubris will be her downfall.
 ,#You know.  I know.  Everybody knows believe me.
 ,We finally are getting a fair honest and open government. Expose the traitors all of them. Take their power away put them away and institute max terms!
 ,I honestly feel like the Trump Campaign knew about everything from the start. They probably talked about crazy hilarious stuff and fake plans the entire time. That is why the globalist machine is so dead set on destroying him at all costs they did all of this and got nothing but trolled.
 ,It’s almost as if the anons already knew this tho with FVEY and everything. New Zealand and Australia not just the UK
 ,I love it when 4D chess comes together.
 ,Oh boy this tweet is most spectacular indeed!!!
 ,lol all of the twitter replies trying to dirty this revelation as a "cOnSpiRaCy tHeOrY". How desperate.

 ,Fine. I wouldn't go anywhere NEAR the U.K (if I was POTUS) until this is sorted out...another reason NOT to go.

 ,Ha he knows and he just made sure everyone else does too damnit I love this timeline so hard!
 ,The truth has already come out though? What more is needed?
 ,They tried to destroy a man who is known for taking revenge. SAD!**ONE OR MORE OF THESE PEOPLE WILL GET INDICTED*** McCabe* Page* Strok* Ohr* Comey * LynchTo save their ass they will talk and that is where the fun begins. #2020 will be even more lit than 2016. Trump will be stomping on weak candidates while their leadership gets arrested left and right. They will be so demoralized that I almost feel sorry for them (almost).They're like drug addicts rn. They won't come around until they hit rock bottom. Right now they are too proud to make nice with us but I expect that to change by the end of summer. It truly saddens me because we can be friends with liberals. Despite their faults they are Americans like us and we wish them to be great. WE WELCOME ALL AMERICANS.

 ,**[Referencing this OANN report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3rqnpbVrO8)**  Trump's problem here is that he has to weigh 'whistleblowing' with National Security interests at this point.  Five Eyes is part of the [apparatus](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/60zbg8/okay_pedes_its_time_for_us_and_president_trump_to/) he has inherited and probably that includes a history of back-patting informal arrangements to spy on each others' citizens. Unlawful yes but also undocumented as hell by design.  Probably a set of computer accesses within the Eyes network whose logs could be purged easily (on Inauguration Day. It's probably a tradition! Comey tying up loose ends in [Australia](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11842034)?)... and secure voice calls not logged at all.  The "Larry Johnson > Andrew Napolitano" backtrace ... even though both men claim multiple inside sources is too tenuous to stand on its own.  They're civilians with hearsay. While I'd like to see the Five and the domestic spying that supports them dismantled in my time... hate to say it... right now it's more important to just push back with zingers like that Tweet than declare a *dangerous* war on the shadow government in public.  He needs to keep on economy energy and immigration and (in his spare time) keep John Brennan on the run.

 ,Thank you Mr. President!  Thank you SCOTUS!
 ,It's always leg day with the left. Trump beat them on immigration by showing that they are hypocrites who don't really care about the illegal aliens when he called them out about sanctuary cities. So they are now moving to voting by felons. Not a popular opinion so they talk about terrorists voting. NEWS SHIFT. Now you forgot about illegals(you didn't). Soon they'll be back to calling you a racist baby hater who won't let the poor immigrants vote for their representation then they'll go back to felons voting because they have no policies they are just trying to get new voters.

 ,CNN: If the SCOTUS allows the Citizenship question here's how it benefits Russia
 ,So libs still flipping their shit then?
 ,Imagine being a citizen of a country and not caring who was there and why they were there. If you leave the door open on your house and let anyone in for any reason what do you think will happen?
 ,There's something very basic about this that I don't understand so someone please ELI5:  What would stop an illegal from just checking the "Sure I'm an American citizen" box?  Okay it'd be illegal but would that really matter to someone who's here illegally already?
 ,You cannot ask about citizenship in a crowded theater.
 ,inb4 they pull a 3/5 compromise stunt to keep their majority in the house
 ,Serious question is it just a question requiring no verification? What's to stop people filling out "yes I am a citizen"?
 ,Woundnt every illegal just answer "yes"?
 ,There are many good arguments against fostering illegal immigration. However I rarely hear a perspective on the unintended consequences of devaluing citizenship. Why should I pay taxes for instance? What value does the social contract have for me if I get the same benefits without it?
 ,To whoever is listening out there and the real world in the positions of power in the halls of the White House I just want you to know the American people support President Trump.
 ,Well they better rule in our favor.  Its a given the liberal hacks will not. Lets see if Kava can deliver
 ,God if this shakes out a lot of these “sanctuaries” are going to lose House seats and federal dollars. It’s going to be beautiful.
 ,Asking if you’re a citizen is racist 🤡🌎
 ,Libs: "REEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Supreme Court obstruction!!"
 ,Anyone able to explain what’s stopping people from lying about the citizenship question?
 ,Hit that deport button. They are brigading hard today!!
 ,"Why is the President of the United States so darned racist?" -Ed KrassensteinDo these brother fuckers understand half the words they say?
 ,Dems gotta get more house seats....They were pissed back in the day when they were deprived of 40% of their apportionment power...   The abolitionists wanted to take all 100% of their power away from them and count slaves as 0 ZERO NOT A PERSON not counted when handing out house seats PERIOD!!!  Because any abolitionist worth their salt knows that a slave cannot by definition have any political power themselves but they can ONLY be used by their slave-masters FOR political power!!!Same old Democrap Shit!   Different Century.
 ,I'm curious why people think they would answer honestly. Wouldn't they just lie and then Democrats would use that number to down play the issue?
 ,Those Krassenstein fellas aren’t well
 ,I'm confused on this. What stops anyone/everyone from just answering yes they are a citizen?
 ,It's going down boys!!! We'll finally have a ruling whether or not Bill Clinton broke the law by allowing the question on the 2000 census.
 ,I was listening to the History of Rome Podcast the other day (it was recorded years ago) talking about Julius Caesar and his census in Rome. I guess it took a bunch of non citizens off of the list for free or price-reduced grain and saved the Republic a ton of money. I can definitely see some parallels here.
 ,Is RGB back at her desk yet? Time for her to retire and open up the job to a functional human.
 ,Dems in CA NY etc...use illegal immigrants to steal seats and resources from the smaller states. Probably will be less supportive of open borders when they aren't benefiting anymore worse their states will be on the hook to support them 100% when they are bused in.
 ,What if all those illegals in California are actually Russians?
 ,I...I just cant believe it. The top comments after the Krassenstein faggots ‏are almost all pro Trump. Twatter must be broken
 ,Can't they just lie and mark themselves as citizens though? Or even just not take the census?
 ,Why does this even matter?  If they are illegal aliens they are already lawbreakers so if they actually did answer the census why wouldn’t they just lie about being citizens too?
 ,He recommends the WH fight every subpoena making the House go to court every time to try to justify it. They have no valid justification. It’s all partisan.
 ,@ [1:35](https://youtu.be/FDtg8z12Q7s?t=95) Ms. Clinton better get a lawyer!
 ,Rudy is the 2nd most winning person alive behind POTUS. Took down the mafia saved NYC led after 9/11 now helped POTUS beat the coup attempt.Hilarious that the leftist loons thought Michael Avenatti (Mr. Life in Prison) would take him down.
 ,“The difference between Hillary’s investigation and the President is that the president is innocent of the underlying crime. Mueller prosecutors couldn’t find any collusion and can’t make a case of obstruction so they  are demanding he exhonerate himself. This is unheard of in American law”.       RUDY!! Is on FiYA 🔥. This was a great sticky watch the whole 8minutes
 ,Her comments are jaw dropping but she knows her fans have no idea that she obstructed justice at every turn and was treated with kid gloves while Trump was treated with complete hostility.
 ,Rudy suggesting the Trump tower meeting was a set up frame job on fox news... a year plus after people like us were making that suggestion here ... feels good man
 ,How fucking stupid do you have to be to even open your mouth on this subject if you're Hillary Clinton?  When I heard her say this I went blank for at least a minute.  Dumb cunt.
 ,Hilary opining on obstruction? What was her intent when she had her staff destroy phones computers and hired a firm to erase her emails?
 ,#HAWT SAUCE
 ,It really is a case of everything that they accuse him of they have actually done.
 ,Love Guiliani he's an absolute beast and an American treasure.  This man risked his own life taking down mobsters who wanted him dead he is not scared of these pieces of shit in DC.
 ,Mad Lad is back.
 ,I'm surprised they let him talk for more than 5 seconds without being interrupted
 ,It’s still all half measures and pulled punches. Where’s the outrage??? Where’s the demand that this bitch sociopath go to prison???
 ,He's right.  There have already been two investigations (FBI counterintel and Mueller) and both came up with donut.  The Democrats are going to want a "do-over" and tie up everything in endless investigations until they get the results they want but that's not how our system works.
 ,Giuliani has the ability to make people watch long videos.
 ,Rudy was spitting out serious truths in this interview.
 ,Mayor Giuliani dropping the hammer! Feels like he touched on almost everything big except for Barry Soetoro’s involvement. If Rudy is this worked up just imagine GEOTUS. The Swamp is in deep deep trouble.
 ,Guiliani is an American badass
 ,What is Crooked whining about now?  Lock her up already.
 ,Could this fox news team learn to STFU? He's making a big point about to go after Hillary and you interrupt him and try to make it all funny? Just stfu and let the man speak.
 ,It all began when they took me from my home  And put me on Death Row  A crime for which I'm totally innocent you know  I began to warm and chill  To objects and their fields  A ragged cup a twisted mop  The face of Jesus in my soup  Those sinister dinner deals  The meal trolley's wicked wheels  A hooked bone rising from my food  And all things either good or ungood  And the mercy seat is waiting  And I think my head is burning  And in a way I'm yearning  To be done with all this weighing of the truth  An eye for an eye  And a tooth for a tooth  And anyway I told the truth  And I'm not afraid to die.  I hear stories from the chamber  Christ was born into a manger  And like some ragged stranger  He died upon the cross  Might I say it seems so fitting in its way  He was a carpenter by trade  Or at least that's what I'm told  My killed hands tattooed E.V.I.L.  across it's brother's fist  That filthy five!  They did nothing to challenge or resist  In Heaven His throne is made of gold  The ark of His Testament is stowed  A throne from which I'm told  All history does unfold.  It's made of wood and wire  And my body is on fire  And God is never far away  Into the mercy seat I climb  My head is shaved my head is wired  And like a moth that tries  To enter the bright eye  I go shuffling out of life  Just to hide in death awhile  And anyway I never lied  And the mercy seat is waiting  And I think my head is burning  And in a way I'm yearning  To be done with all this weighing of the truth  An eye for an eye  And a tooth for a tooth  And anyway I told the truth  And I'm not afraid to die.  And the mercy seat is burning  And I think my head is glowing  And in a way I'm hoping  To be done with all this twistin' of the truth  An eye for an eye  And a tooth for a tooth  And anyway there was no proof  And I'm not afraid to die  And the mercy seat is glowing  And I think my head is smokin'  And in a way I'm hoping  To be done with all these looks of disbelief.  A life for a life  And a truth for a truth  And I've got nothing left to lose  And I'm not afraid to die  And the mercy seat is smokin'  And I think my head is melting  And in a way that's helping  To be done with all this twistin' of the truth  An eye for an eye  And a truth for a truth  And anyway I told the truth  But I'm afraid I told a lie.
 ,Hillary talking shit again?
 ,What is this in response to? What did clinton say?
 ,The GUILTY SCREAM THE LOUDEST!!
 ,Because you’d be in jail.
 ,Until indictments start happening against these people their base will continue to believe Trump is the criminal.
 ,Thank God for Rudy Giuliani!
 ,Yes.
 ,Great
 ,Hillary really did come across as kind of dipshit."If it was anyone else there would have been an Indictment"&#x200B;REALLY?? HAVE YOU BEEN INDICTED YET YOU UTTER TROGLODYTE?
 ,For all those who complain how HRC is an old woman and should be left alone - she never goes away. She runs her mouth in hopes of causing unrest. She is an agent of chaos. Instead of sitting on a porch with her grand babies HRC wants to watch America burn believing such a sacrifice is worth it as long as her secrets stay buried.
 ,Can't wait for the day.... /r/HillaryForPrison
 ,Plante March 7: Mr. President when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the U.S. government for official business while she was secretary of state?Obama: The same time everybody else learned it through news reports." LIAR!
 ,These are *NOT* the 33000 deleted emails.  This headline is wrong. These are simply regular emails from Clinton to the White House.What's important is that this is the first official confirmation that Obama was lying when he said he didn't know she had her own server. We knew that was true because Bob Ama showed up in the Podesta drop but this is actually coming from the government.
 ,B-B-B-But that’s impossible! Hillary wiped her server clean..with a cloth
 ,He built that.
 ,Why and how are these anti-Americans (DemocRATS) not in jail yet?
 ,On Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Don’t forget that part!!  I’m sure they were in his life insurance folder.
 ,Try posting in this in r/politics and it blocks the post saying it’s against the community guidelines. They decide what their people see.
 ,When will Congress demand them in unredacted form?
 ,Found in Obama's office.  What exactly does that mean?   In his desk on a thumb drive?  Printed out on sheets of paper?  Why would Obama save them?
 ,Is that where her neck is hiding too?
 ,#THEY WERE ALL DOING ITThere's no way the Obama Justice Department could have allowed HRC - or anyone at State - to be prosecuted for subverting federal records law or mishandling classified information because it would inevitably come back to them.  They would never prosecute themselves.  And there was no way Clinton was taking the fall for it given her impending presidential bid (it was Her Turn!).  She knew and they knew that if an investigation led to federal indictments she was taking them all to prison with her.Every.  Single.  One.
 ,So if I were to destroy 33000 already-subpoenaed documents  I just have to say I didn't intend to do it and I'm good to go right?
 ,> “This astonishing confirmation made under oath by the FBI shows that the Obama FBI had to go to President Obama’s White House office to find emails that Hillary Clinton tried to destroy or hide from the American people.” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “No wonder Hillary Clinton has thus far skated – Barack Obama is implicated in her email scheme.”Wew lad.

 ,Military Tribunals would be cute idk
 ,Can someone explain to me what Judicial Watch actually is? Sorry for the noob question. I keep reading about Judicial Watch findings but don’t understand if there are actual implications and if Trump is in the know/working with them. Plz help. Thanks.
 ,Obama caught lying = nothing will happen.  The media will cover so hard for him and even if he's caught with his pants down they'll just blame a random advisor or claim *national security*.  This is a great vindication of what we all knew that obama is a lying piece of shit anti-American radical.
 ,The media controls the country. It doesnt matter how corrupt or obvious. If the media doesnt scream about it like banshees nothing happens.There needs to be a fucking change to this gross system. It was supposed to be Trump but the media SCREAMED like banshees that he was a russian agent... didnt matter how ridiculous. They stopped his momentum in the disgustinf swamp.
 ,I was just wondering for a second why there isn't a government agency called "Judicial Watch". But then I realized that if it were a government agency it would just become corrupt as hell.

 ,'clean this up'  these clowns are so dirty i can smell them from Scotland
 ,Since 2004 I have lost 12 friends to pills and heroin. I saw the pill epidemic sweep across NH and seen some really bad bad things that my friends were doing that made me flee the state in 2006 because i did not want to end up like them. The thing they did and who they became weren't something I could bare to witness. Heroin is a horrible drug and the people at the top who peddle it to ruin communities know what they are doing. It's not just a little community problem it's a world wide epidemic and its completely out of control by design.
 ,This is going to be amazing.

 ,The reason there is such a massive heroin problem in Portland and Seattle (literally needles everywhere in parks where kids play) is because deep down left wing dudes know they’re full of shit and they hate themselves when they look in the mirror.

 ,You know Trump is on when they play his favorite song! :)
 ,Thank you Mr. President! Thanks also for getting Rx prices lowered--before the dems make this a centerpiece!
 ,IF only we can get the wall funded and built so we can help restrict the drugs from coming in here further. Too bad the Dems won't listen to that.
 ,Fantastic hearing any recovery story from drugs. Its a tough road.
 ,Our immigration laws do need to be fixed but Congress mainly the Dems don't want to listen at all. And there is major proof of that.

 ,I seen what those drugs can do on TV shows mainly the show called "Cops." That showed me to stay away from that poison.

 ,half-pede..... that's all I ever heardhalf-pede... how i learned to love the word
 ,Her Twitter is still very anti trump. Let’s just pray she sees the light

 ,Silly Cher she thought she was allowed to make up her own mind about things.
 ,When did she change her stance? I seem to remember her saying something very pro illegal immigrants not to long ago..
 ,Our gal?
 ,What a world we live in where Cher is considered far to the right of the Democrat party.
 ,She’s clearly alt-right. /s

 ,She’s just waiting for Biden to announce
 ,Yes. Yes.  Let the hate flow through you....

 ,They are all losing their minds and cannibalizing each other. Let them eat.It will be glorious.
 ,thats cool and all but the rest of her twitter is a complete dumpster fire of lib bullshit
 ,It’s ok Cher don’t let the bastards get you down.  Social media (and Hollywood for that matter) is an insidious thing.  Bad people trickle down bad ideas and brainwash people with weak minds.  This is the result.  It’s BEYOND common sense but we have forces that want to destroy the moral fibers of America and have found a way to do it.  Up is down down is up.  It’s craziness anymore.
 ,i'm starting to believe that there is a limit to cognitive dissonance... once that wall is breached and the person begins to think for themselves and express their views they will experience 1st hand the hate the hypocrisy and  the alienation from the Left...a person can only stand so much before they questions previously held beliefs  i. e. they'll have to  re-examine their own blind hatred for Trump conservative values etc.Cher has started down the slippery slope
 ,Winning feels good man.
 ,I think Cher is beginning to realize when it comes to stating your opinion you are damned if you signal virtue and you're damned when you discuss logic so she may as well speak her mind .
 ,Sometimes the red-pilling is a slow process.
 ,#watching the Red Pill work its way through Cher's central nervous system has been extremely entertaining!

 ,Poor Cher. The good parts of Sonny manage to still have some connection but the Hollywood part keeps trying to repress her common sense.

 ,This is hilarious but it's exactly how lefties get redpilled. They say something publicly that seems like common sense but doesn't follow the script. They get backlash. &nbsp;Then if they don't capitulate they experience the full REEEE. Next thing you know they are wearing a maga hat and posting in here about how they have seen the light.

 ,I’ve been correct about all of my predictions so far even went so far as to promise to eat an entire shoe if Jussie got punished. I’ll stick with it and say I’ll eat a shoe live on YouTube if any one of these people sees any sort of punishment. Whether it be a fine a court appearance or (a miracle) jail time.

 ,George H.W. Bush ordered our troops into Somalia in 1992 after he had lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton.  Bush '41 said he based his decision on a TIME magazine cover photo of a starving Somali boy hunched over with a vulture in the background.   Bush '41 knew Clinton had written a letter to military recruitment officers saying "I loathe the military".  We literally went into Somalia to feed them.  Mullah Farah Aidid was a warlord that was stealing the food and only giving it to his tribe.  Ilhan Omar's family belonged to a different tribe that was targeted by Aidid and other warlords.  At the age of 4 Ilhan Omar and her family were forced to flee and ended up in a UN sponsored refugee camp in Kenya. The refugee camps were plagued with violence rape and theft.  When Ilhan Omar was 9 Bill Clinton and the late Senator Paul Wellstone decided to bring all those Somalis in Kenyan refugee camps and plunk them down in Minnesota.   Lutheran Social Services and Catholic Charities were given lucrative government grants to help re-settle the Somalis in Minnesota. Ilhan Omar went to public schools got a college degree and never faced a day of want in the U.S.  In return for that Ilhan Omar accused Elliot Abrams of supporting war crimes in El Salvador (he didn't and even his main attacker years later admitted Eliot Abrams was right).     She calls the U.S. intervention in Somalia to put down Mullah Muhammed Farah Aidid a terrorist attack even though he targeted her clan for elimination and pushed them out of Somalia.   She asked a judge to be lenient toward Somalis that joined ISIS.  She has made several anti-Semitic statements and denigrates our ally Israel.  She claims she is treated like a second class citizen while she's a sitting congressional representative.  Whenever she's criticized for her behavior she claims the criticism is  Islamophobic.    She's sponsored by CAIR which is a Muslim Brotherhood front in the U.S. and supports terrorism around the globe.  She tells members of CAIR to "raise hell" and "make others uncomfortable."   She has openly supported the socialist dictator in Venezuela Maduro while America was carrying on operations to deliver aid food and medicine to the people of Venezuela.  Every American needs to think long and hard about whether we should ever interfere "to help people" across the globe again.  If a damn 9 year old girl can be saved brought to the U.S. and enjoy all the fruits of our nation and still hate us to the bottom of her heart all our "good will" around the world is just us being gullible chumps.  When the uniparty says we have to be the world's leader and we have to stabilize the globe remember with all our good will we couldn't even convince a nine year old girl that we're not evil.  The globalist uniparty must be defeated because their arrogance and hubris will destroy this country.
 ,They did not come in the US to assimilate and live in a country which offers them more than theirs they came to colonize.&#x200B;the west should start defending themselves and pass laws were citizenship can be stripped easily when importing snakes.
 ,Oh boy... let's import a few million more.
 ,Exactly why she needs the boot straight back to Somalia.
 ,She has connections to the Muslim Brotherhood. A "group" that Obama helped in the Arab Spring. Obama imported the voters she needed to get into Congress. Not that hard to figure out what her plans where going to be when she won. Destroy America from within.
 ,Do we have to link to the hill? That bought and paid for shill shit gives me brain cancer. The site itself is extremely partisan but good God look at the comments section. I dare you.
 ,And now she gets intel that can put American lives at risk if it were to "fall" into the wrong hands.
 ,In her defense I'm sure allot of that 'anger' stems from having her clit sliced off years ago
 ,Thank Obama for relocating a shit load of refugees to that part of the country. Now we have our enemies with representation in Congress.
 ,Well her family were pirates... according to a friend.
 ,Exactly what the Dems want.
 ,Being a so-called "Refugee" means that our country rescued her and she repays us by shitting all over us. She needs to be deported back to where she came from so she can learn to appreciate what our country did for her.
 ,I have a friend who recently obtained the citizenship and was hearing of the things he needed to go through like interviews and so on to finally go to the ceremony event in the nearest big city. I cannot imagine that she could get a citizenship even already very loosen citizenship exam and requirement.
 ,GTFO
 ,Just like every other Muslim.
 ,We need a "must be natural born citizen" to be in congress amendment
 ,She literally looks like a snake devil creature. Black nails?
 ,This is typical of some of our "immigrants and refugees".........Social cohesion is down the drain

 ,A prime example of why immigration needs to be stopped. No more for 30 years.
 ,Stacy Abrams sister?
 ,Wtf. Everyday with these lunatic professors. Next the air is racist because it went into my lungs not the black persons next to me.
 ,So why not just get places on fucking time then they won't be oppressed 🙄
 ,I guess salads are racist too.
 ,Perhaps the most aggravating aspect of all of this is the term "black people".  The racist left loves to paint with abroad brush.More accurately she should be saying that incompetent boobs are often late.
 ,This bitch looks like she is on time to the buffet everyday.    Disgusting sweat hog
 ,These professors just pick something they are having difficulty with or if they’re white something they believe blacks have trouble with and say it’s racist (kind of stereotypical and racist if you ask me) Example:Blacks don’t speak well and have poor grammar—-you’re just imposing white English on them they deserve their own language. In fact you should teach Ebonics in school. Fact: there’s plenty of articulate black people who use correct grammar. Though Biden seems to think Obama is the first articulate and clean black personNow punctuality 😂  maybe that’s just a personal problem. These liberals in trying to be non- racist are saying black people are dirty late violent people who can’t speak. But they’re not racist... everyone else is
 ,Fuck yeah time is racist. All of my black friends swear by CPT (colored people time where time intervals are delayed by an arbitrary random factor not less than +17 minutes) and how a minute can mean literally any length of time. So yeah time is a racist cunt.
 ,The Wypipo have the time stone
 ,Rutgers must be very proud of her.
 ,That is exactly what I expected her to look like from the headline.  I'm just sad her name isn't literally Big Bertha.  We were lied to as children.  You can judge a book by its cover.
 ,Is Maxine Waters a White supremacist under this new standard? She loves saying she's reclaiming her time. It must be a dog whistle!
 ,god dammit lunchtime is over already?i havent finished eating this dragoncrocodilewhalepig and DIET COKE!Time is sooooo racist!!!!
 ,It’s unfortunate but I have come to refer to it as “black people time”. If I have a meeting with a black person I will try to be on-time but I won’t try very hard because “black people time”
 ,The IQ Bell curve is symmetric; for every person with 120 IQ there is someone with 80 IQ. For every theoretical physicist there's someone like this woman.
 ,What's racist is the fact she is exploiting curious minds to sign up for mounds of debt to get such a stupid degree.Her whole wellbeing comes from the manipulation of young feeble minds.  Gender Studies?  Is your internship as a Starbucks barista?
 ,If she thinks time is racist how does she justify having her own timezone?
 ,It looks like she can't put down the junk food for any period of time.
 ,She's always late because she's not finished eating.
 ,Life is racist that’s what my prediction is
 ,honk
 ,TIL because I'm always late I'm black!
 ,You have to have the intelligence quotient of a cinder block to become a gender studies professor
 ,Translation; I think the world revolves around me and don't want to go to work on time. Black people really put nearly no effort in avoiding becoming stereotypes.
 ,Literally everything is racist. Not being racist is racist!
 ,Her statement is completely ridiculous. Her reasoning if you'll pardon me for calling it that is asinine.
 ,Well time hasn't been kind to her. I can see why she'd hate it.
 ,Vegetables and exercise must be too.
 ,Brittney Cooper is always late not because she's black... but because she had to stop and get an extra HoHo on her way out the door... the big fat fucken stupid bitch!
 ,Sure Brittney. But no matter what you try you cannot force restaurants to make their all you can buffets stay open 24 hours.
 ,But who owns Colored People Time?
 ,We've transitioned from the subtle racism of lowered expectations to the overt racism of lowered expectations.
 ,Is there even one "Gender Studies" professor who is within an acceptable BMI?  I swear every one I see is a huge land whale.
 ,Oh hey I've heard that one before. Like years ago before SJWs went mainstream. There was for a while a notion hanging around that timeliness punctuation and work ethic are "white" concepts and expecting blacks to be punctual timely and ethical was in fact racist.I doth not shiteth thou.
 ,I watched a tv show for the first time called the Amazing Race... it wasn't about white people? So confusing.
 ,We can either age or move at the speed of light ?
 ,I think we're going to need a rainbow clownworld flair...
 ,once everything is racist nothing will be racist
 ,And these people actually get paid. Jesus...
 ,I vaguely recall Hilliary making a joke about "black people time."
 ,Just because it takes her an hour to walk a flight of stairs does not make it time’s fault
 ,Gender Studies is racist because it is destroying the human race!
 ,I’m still in denial that a gender studies degree is a real thing
 ,So there is colored time and non-colored time?
 ,Does she have have any clue.
 ,There is nothing that isn't racist according to these imbeciles. The fact that this women is an associate professor just shows what a joke the education system has become with these useless degrees.
 ,White men can't jump.... is gravity racist?
 ,Apparently diets are also racist
 ,Are you telling me mambo number five is racist? My life is ruined

 ,Damn white people and their monopoly on time.
 ,if it had a bmi it would probably be low too

 ,Paul's new site is fantastic!  Every clownworld headline is hilarious!
 ,Im sure when its dinner time shes never late. Or for any meal for that matter
 ,Ah yes. Time. That force that affects us all without discrimination. So racist.
 ,Is that why they are always 30 minutes late? /s
 ,Being on time means many things in a professional environment. 1) you are able to commit and follow through2) you respect other people3) you understand deadlines and can meet them4) you know how to manage priorities and backwards plan5) you are a professional. Time is not racist. It’s called being an adult.

 ,It's only racist if you dwell on the past.  Present & future are all equal opportunity.
 ,Cooper said that black people have a reputation for being late.  Fine but time is not racism time is an absolute it doesn't pick sides. Time just happens whether you like it or not.  But she is the racist because she calls black people lazy.

 ,How can time be racist when scientists have said that time does not really exist?Moe proof that the Left is anti-science.

 ,There is no such thing as colored people time only self absorbed individuals who don’t respect other people’s schedules.  Society needs time to function.

 ,Hey this is not a joke.  I am a retired nurse.  Shift report is supposed to start promptly at 0700 since night shift is on the clock and wants to get out at 07:30.  I used to work with a black nurse who was chronically 15 minutes late.  She would laugh it off saying she ran on CPT -- Colored People's Time. It threw the whole unit off and caused lots of end of shift OT.   My manager was too whimpy to address it since it was a black thang.

 ,Ah yes... Rutgers. So glad my Nittany Lions beat up on them every year in football.
 ,Do they just look at random words in the dictionary and call them racist?
 ,Black people also have a reputation for talking non-stop inside of movie theaters. I guess it's because they all had to live in slave quarters and could not talk outside while they were picking cotton. So speech is owned by white people.
 ,The very fabric of reality is a racist construct.
 ,time doesn't exist  it's a human made idea to track down history
 ,This isn't a problem exclusive to people of color. Try living in an Arab country or southern Europe. It's a cultural thing. Time is relative to many different cultures including European. From an American perspective time is valuable. To a Japanese perspective Americans waste time and showing up on time is lazy you should always be early. However in Italian culture on time is when you get there. I've been around the world and it's a cultural thing. However that being said American culture demands you be where you are expected to be when you are expected to be. If you live in America you need to conform to American expectations.

 ,Honestly what are African-Americans motivation for being MAGA? Is it because they are middle class and don’t want oppressive taxes? I ask because the dems are hell bent on brainwashing African Americans so I’m curious how a black man would come around to the right.

 ,Not a good look for the man who combs his hair with a balloon...
 ,Prisoners were REMOVED from society for a reason. They CANNOT participate in society for a reason. They lose their right to vote in that society becasue they've proven they cannot abide by the rules of that society.  When they've paid their debt to society THEN we can talk about restoring their right to vote in that society.  This is called "common sense" not pandering for votes.
 ,Won't someone please *please* think of the poor benighted convicted child molesters and what *they* think their nation's direction should be.
 ,I can just picture Crazy Bernie downstairs in his lab concocting all these batshit crazy plans like some sort of mad Communist scientist.
 ,Will the inmates have to show proof of citizenship?
 ,The reason he's doing this is worse than you think. It's his way of getting in good graces with blacks. Because he's a racist liberal fuck that said it was racist to talk shit about felons.
 ,So to leftists Nazis aren't people but paedos and murderers are? I'm starting to agree what sort of wacko clown 🤡 world are we living in?
 ,Left wingers fighting like hell for the child molester vote. This is who they are.
 ,When do the murder victims get back *their* right to vote?
 ,Weird that they want Dylann Roof to vote
 ,On a positive note my wife was laughing and reading me the rants from her wealthy leftist clients on Facebook who were disgusted by the idea of letting people in prison vote and saying they would no longer be supporting Bernie or any candidate that agreed with this position.
 ,Dont forget the increased murder rates when people figure out they can get pardoned for killing the opposition.
 ,I dont want a kiddy diddler decided Jack shit for my country
 ,Does Bernie self-sabotage himself from winning? He wants the attention but not the responsibility of actually enacting his proposals.
 ,Total bullshit!
 , This ballon hair combing ass has lost what was ever left in that prehistoric cranium.
 ,Therefore taking your vote away leftists actually agree to this but don’t want a rapist babysitting their children. As seen on a new Katlin Bennet video.
 ,\#soprogressive
 ,That is a lot of rapists.
 ,America is so free and fair that democrats have no reasonable policies any more RIP their party
 ,Bernie Sanders knows that even if all Socialists aren't rapists at least all rapists will vote Socialist. I wonder if Sanders will permit people in prison for tax evasion and bank fraud vote along side Socialist serial killers and Socialist Boston Bombers.
 ,\#onelessvote
 ,You think there is a study out there that shows what side they would vote for?
 ,The feel when you're ideas are so much bullshit you need convicts to vote for you to get elected.
 ,He’s the supreme Drooly Retard.
 ,The fact that the left is pushing voting for 16 year olds rapists murderers and reparation for their black pet voters tells me they feel they might not have the game rigged enough yet. Or just hedging their bets.
 ,Honestly this might lose him the nomination. Americans don't want this and it's too good of propoganda for the right
 ,Quik Mafz!
 ,How many nazi though?
 ,The real reason why Bernie wants pedophiles and terrorists and murderers to vote is because 68% of prisoners are not white with 37% being African American and 22% American-Hispanic.
 ,why the fuck are democrats pandering to everyone but law abiding American Citizens? seriously foreigners prisoners drug addicts illegal aliens... it is like they want to lose.
 ,Is Bernie detarded?
 ,You are a felon you lose the right to vote.It is not an inherent right. You forfeit that right when you break the law and are convicted.It's supposed to be a deterrent to not break the law(s).
 ,Bill Clinton could forever be mayor of many cities with a large prison population.
 ,Bernie supports toxic masculinity voting rights
 ,I’m from China and in China if you’re a felon you’ll be deprived of any political rights. Well you can argue people in China don’t actually vote but I think even China knows better than the radical left!
 ,The left is going to really lose it after 2020
 ,Is he going to let them buy guns again too?
 ,How many white supremacists does he want to allow to vote? There are a lot of those in jail
 ,This makes me happy because it means they are extremely desperate.  Trying to let illegals vote shows the same thing.  They know they are FUCKED if they can't pull these extra votes out of their ass.  If this weren't the case they would never ever try proposing such insane policies.
 ,DemocRATS are doing everything in their power (bringing in illegal aliens letting murderers and rapists vote) to draw more support and votes to their side. This is UNACCEPTABLE and should not be allowed at all cost.
 ,Never going to happen this is a distraction
 ,Those murderers and rapists are luck they are still breathing. Forget the whole voting thing
 ,This is such blatant election tampering. Its something along those lines. Trying to pad voter roles. Theres so many reasons this is a terrible idea and a terrible platform to run on.   Like im gonna trust votes coming from behind locked gates. This is ripe for fraud. Plus criminals vote dem 7 out of 10. Thats why they want this. Fkin cheats
 ,Why do Democrats assume prisoners will all vote  Democrat? How many prisoners are we talking about? Is it a significant number enough to throw an election one way or the other? I don't think it's worth talking about. Prisoners LOST their rights as citizens! They should be able to vote soon as they get out. Why push this? Democrats still use the "old ways" of controlling voters. To a Democrat voters are DUMB IMPRESSIONABLE EASILY  MANIPULATED people. Can't you see they keep trying to lure the ones who cannot think for themselves? It work on Blacks for decades. They got in power from the Black vote. Yet they've one absolutely NOTHING for Blacks except make it easier to get on welfare and KEEP on it for life. THAT'S IT!  Now they're trying to get the illegals and "brown people" vote. 16 year old kids. Ban Electoral College. This is not "good politics" at ALL. These are attempts to undermine and RUIN our tried and true way of doing things only for THEIR BENEFIT. We had better get out in WAVES in 2020. If a Democrat should ever win again I guarantee they WILL become the DICTATOR and slap this great Nation with SOCIALISM. They freely talk about it like it's some "Wonderful deal". We KNOW it ISN'T.
 ,Now the press will spend 2 years interviewing victims of rape and terrorism asking them if they think the person who did it should be able to vote and decide their future right?That’s what they did with healthcare..
 ,Why would bad people vote any differently than good people?Oh yeah because they're bad people.  Bernie hasn't quite grasped that foundational fact yet.How can they not realize how stupid this is?
 ,Because all they have to do is get a state within the margin of error and the cheat machine takes over.  Thats a lot of votes all for the Dem candidate by the way and can sway an election.  And all from people who have proven they couldn't be trusted in the first place.
 ,I mean literally if you give murders the right to vote their vote just replaces the people that they kill so to speak. They just devoid the world of one/multiple vote by just replacing it with their vote.
 ,Remember when something like willie horton was enough to damage a presidential candidate?  Now a few hundred thousand felons potentially voting and bernie supports don’t bat an eye.
 ,Harvesting votes from anywhere possible?
 ,They gave up that right when they committed the crime to do the time.
 ,a THIRD OF A MILLION NEW DEMOCRAT VOTERS....IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE MARGINS CAN BE RAZOR THIN....LET THAT SINK IN...
 ,that was the nail in bernie's coffin. he was already done when he sold out to hillary and company and the shit with his money scams and summer homes and shit but that townhall was sooooo fucked up O.o he couldn't even answer the questions or stand up for anything he believes in lol.that was fucked :X
 ,They are concerned when they are all locked up that they can still vote. /r/HillaryForPrison
 ,And they can get the right people to apply some prison justice if turnout and the way was voted is not good enough. Also rewards for doing the same.
 ,Bernie Sanders loves rapists.
 ,The democrats are truly the party of criminals. Can’t argue about that now can they?Their next move? Everybody anywhere in the world can vote too. All they care for is power. Constitution be damned.
 ,Dem radicals will lose 2020 for the Dems. And moderate Dems don't have the cojones to stand up to them. El Donaldo si getting tired of winning almost.
 ,But but aren't Republicans the murderers and rapists? My TV told me that! On a serious note I don't know if letting people in jail vote would actually help the Democrats like they might think.
 ,Socialist Math :)
 ,Love when self-confessed socialists talk about democracy like it will be something that will still be around when they have total control.He knows its an issue conservatives will hate. That's why he is bringing it up. Not as something he will do it's so they can use it against conservatives.  Everything is a weapon to them. Is it something they will do if one of them wins?Nope. Don't think people realize that whoever is the next Democrat to get into the WH (even after two Trump terms) is going to be nothing like what has come before. Not even like Obama. Not even like Hillary if she had won. As none of these people would be currently running and in Kamala Harris case. No one would know who she was. These people want to bring America into a new socialist age. Kicking and screaming if they have to.
 ,And Jared Kushner's dad.
 ,How is it that a socialist is allowed to hold any office in a democratic nation.  This is what is totally absurd to me.  Who elects them?  Do we really want this?
 ,thank you bernie very cool!^/s
 ,Just imagine the backlash trump would get if he said this just imagine
 ,I'd bet Democrats happen to know the ratio of convicted felons that vote Democrat vs Republican. I'd rather politicians stick to gerrymandering for votes over bringing in criminals and allowing our own criminals to vote...
 ,Voting used to be a privilege - now it is a right.  College used to be a privilege - now it is a right.  Income used to be a result of effort - now it is a right.  Citizenship used to be a privilege - now it is a right.  Dems have destroyed all incentive for people to work hard and be better.
 ,They will be trading their votes for doritos.
 ,It’s laughable because neither R not D will do anything for these people but the D’s lie to get their votes. Much like the poor minorities they pander to for votes. They’re using them for power. It’s deceptive and immoral.
 ,They should do a trial run first where they vote for their own wardens and prison guards first we'll let that run for a decade and assess.
 ,This could have been the DNCs egress plan for Bernie. They dont want him to stir up the pot as was done in 2016 (Former Bernie bro he killed HRC in every debate). But yes pretty sure this is gonna be that token to nuke him from verbal battles with other dem candidates in a sense. Playing field just widened with Joe Biden planning on Thursday to enter the 2020 race can't bad mouth him right?
 ,If you looked into it further he cites the fact that these criminals are counted as potential voters in final counts. It’s more like “If you are going to use them for gerrymandering give them a vote.”
 ,Voting is a privilege and they lost it when they went to jail.
 ,Bernie is 100% a fall guy again. You can't run on this and win. His job is to take one for the team to let others pass it to get those votes.
 ,Heavy prison population could control local municipal vote... cool
 ,An observation: if you murder one two or three people who could have voted you have meddled in the election by denying others their right to vote - permanently. Why should you then still be allowed to vote?
 ,This will go one of two ways:The prisoners will vote mostly for democrats and the democrats will talk about how people in prison must be treated humanely and how important it is for them to be able to vote.ORThe prisoners will vote mostly for republicans and the democrats will talk about how the republicans are the “party of crime” because all the criminals support them. Similar to how they slander republicans as white supremacists because the KKK votes republican. Either way it isn’t good.
 ,yeah this is not going to help them win the vote. This is a dumb thing for them to be support of. Talk about career suicide....
 ,It's funny that everybody knows murderers and rapist all lean to the left.
 ,Don’t forget Nazi’s kkk members and skinheads. How long until the left figures that one out.
 ,Bernie will promise to free them if they vote for him. He's just trying to get another block of voters.
 ,Why does it seem like every dem candidate is running on the exact same platform?
 ,Plus ILLEGALS!!
 ,go look at the John Ward video making fun of Kamala Harris talking to Don Lemon about this! its kinda funny if you like watching train wrecks lol
 ,Ah but to Bernie and his ilk these are mere criminals. aka victims of an unjust system. His tune would probably change about people his socialist regime jails for disagreeing with him.
 ,Can you also imagine small areas where there are large prisons? Suddenly the penitentiary is electing gang members as Mayor. Come on how dumb are these people I don't get how they lose 100% support from stupid ideas like this.
 ,Voting isn't a right it's a privilege. Don't let these America-hating fuckers to use the word "right." People have a right to their life and their safety
 ,This is all part of a problem that the left has been having for a long time now: the inability to differentiate civil rights from human rights.Bernie's case for wanting to allow convicts to vote while in prison is the idea that "prisoners still have rights". The truth is prisoners do have rights but not civil rights. When you're convicted of a crime and you're incarcerated you give up your civil rights until you've paid your debt to society.Prisoners have their God-given human rights but the right to vote is not a human right. It's a civil right. That's exactly why illegal immigrants are not supposed to have the right to vote either. It's because civil rights are reserved for citizens.
 ,If this becomes law. You will see deranged D's murdering R's left and right. If 1 D kills 4 R's that's a net pickup of 5 votes for D's and that's all they care about.
 ,Voting from prison or jail would be ripe for fraud.  The presumption for Bernie is that democrats would get more votes.  Disturbing the things that democrats are willing to do to try to get elected.
 ,What did Al Bundy do?
 ,Democrat platform 2020&#x200B;I wonder how leftist will defend this idea.
 ,This makes perfect sense actually.  How else are we going to elect criminals unless we allow criminals to vote?
 ,HONK HONK
 ,oooh I bet I know who they're voting for!
 ,They need voters.
 ,In rural areas with low population and a prison  prisoners will be the largest voting block.Prison voting : check16 year olds voting : checkIllegals voting : checkDems have no shame when it comes to rustling up low quality votes.
 ,So they want the votes of actual neo nazis?
 ,These scumbags are lucky to be alive why the hell would Bernie allow this shit?
 ,Are Democrats admitting that most felons are Democrat by wanting them to vote? That's rather telling isn't it
 ,So would crazy hair Bernie and Kamasutra Harris count the golden State killer as two votes since he is both a serial murderer and a serial rapist?
 ,The leftist governor of Virginia did it in 2016 and allowed all incarcerated felons in the state of Virginia the opportunity to vote in the presidential election.&#x200B;Make no mistake about it pedes these leftist cucks will do anything to get elected.  Wait until the election rigging begins.
 ,Congratulations! You lefties can now win CA by 8 million votes instead of 7.8 million.
 ,I don't get why this is a bad thing. Punishment for crimes is prison time and/or a fine and being branded a felon. How is it not unconstitutional to remove the right to vote from felons? They aren't less American citizens than others.
 ,So when murderers and rapists vote are they representing the county they're currently incarcerated in or the county they *used* to reside in or the county they **raped** and **murdered** someone in?  I guess that would be my question for Mr. Sanders.
 ,Would the vote count towards the state they lived? Or the state they are incarcerated?

 ,[A very big Caravan of over 20000 people started up through Mexico. It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming. Mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the Border & call up the Military. The Coyotes & Cartels have weapons](http://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1121012339552194560)[Mexico’s Soldiers recently pulled guns on our National Guard Soldiers probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the Border.

 ,So when does it become an invasion force when an armed illegal crosses the border? We know Mexico is a Narco-terrorist country. So why not just call it how it is already. I can't wait for the HARDCORE GEOTUS to be unleashed when it comes close to the 2020 election.

 ,Just put a bullet in them the second their feet hit American soil.
 ,What the fuck?!
 ,M-1s and A-10s.Back them up with AC-130s and AH-64s.That is just for the border with Canada.Send a more powerful force to keep out Mexico Central America and South America and to stop them from invading over the southern border and to stop them assisting other countries from bringing in drugs terrorists and weapons north from Mexico.

 ,Why would anyone immigrate to the U.S. legally when there's a greater incentive to come here illegally?I just learned yesterday on this subreddit that illegal immigrants can get what they call a ITIN number which is a replacement for a social security number.  It was signed into law by Clinton in 1996 and the kicker is that the IRS is prohibited by LAW from sharing it with the DHS.This gives illegal immigrants better protection than even the President of the U.S. because the Democrats just subpenoed the IRS to get President Trump's tax records.

 ,**This is a NATIONAL EMERGENCY! Trump declare war against Mexico!**
 ,If someone where to engage them what would come of it? Someone is invading by show of force and the possibility of using it. Even deeper to think what if the militia was hanging out saw those guys and engaged and say the cartel was killed. Would Mexico defend them them?
 ,#This is a fantastic use of technology which is exactly what left is calling for instead of fences and I agree that it’s fantastic.

 ,Well according to the narrative this attack was a retaliation for Christchurch. We are expected to believe that known Islamic terrorists in a completely different country thousands of miles away did not want to do these bombings until the Christchurch shooting. At which point they orchestrated all the planning to create 8 suicide vests and bomb several different locations and get it done on a rush because they only had 34 days until Easter. The reality is Islamic terrorists attacks on Christians tend to be centered around major Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter.

 ,If all Mujahideen are Khawarij who are on the true path? - Q&A - Sh. Dr. Haitham al-Haddad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7LRUUocmKkIt was narrated from Nu’aym ibn Hammaar that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Which of the martyrs is best? He said: “Those who when they took up their position in the ranks did not turn their faces away until they were killed. They will be in the dwellings on high in Paradise and their Lord smiles upon them and **when your Lord smiles upon a slave in this world he will not be brought to account**.” Narrated by Ahmad (21970); classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (2558). https://islamqa.info/en/answers/71284/some-of-the-rulings-on-jihad-degrees-of-martyrdom-and-the-life-of-the-martyrs-after-deathThis rhetoric and teaching in Islam is how a devout and moderate Muslim is made to kill.How many people are depressed and suicidal? Blow yourself up for the sake of Allah and go to the highest paradise next to the prophets.This is what is taught to men who can fight. The only argument is which sect do we fight for? There is no Caliph. But if there is a caliph who the people accept and he calls for jihad... people would respond. They really truly believe this. Some of them are convinced to die for Allah easier than others. Most of them are peaceful moderates but that doesn't change the fact that these teachings are real and they are enticing to people who are delusional and already enraptured by Islam. Praying five times a day is a pretty thorough way to convince people of anything and force them to submit. We have a serious threat to the entire free world. It is endless. It has been going on for 1400 years. It is still going on. And everyone wants to pretend it is changing. Yet churches are still being blown up. Innocent girls are married off. Homosexuals are murdered for the crime of loving the same gender. Journalists are murdered for being in the wrong place with the wrong opinions. Media stations are burned for drawing cartoons of Muhammad. The list is endless. [Even the Buddhists are pissed off.](https://youtu.be/qvEBaAiy5b4)
 ,So ugly even goats reject him.
 ,This dude looks like an angry muppet.
 ,Simple ban bombs. Let the government buy everyone's bombs back.
 ,It's racism on their part pure and simple. They don't give a fuck since it happened in a brown country like Sri Lanka.
 ,They covered it this morning on npr.
 ,Send in the SEALS
 ,Who do you think \*owns\* the press? Hello.
 ,How many times you wants media coverage? All international media only coverages Sri Lanka  blasts I have not seen any other news except Sri Lanka blasts
 ,And these people are voting in elections. God help us.
 ,The White House is full of guns...dumb kids.
 ,It's tragic how the youth has been utterly brainwashed. We have to take back the entertainment and media scene especially. Music movies books tv big YouTube channels are all controlled by rabid liberals and they brainwash the youth. We have to fight back. Memes alone aren't enough. We all have to support a decent YouTube competitor. Is bitchute actually viable? Are they cucked as well?
 ,We...dont want those to be gun free zones ya dumb cum dumpsters
 ,Meh in my state my permit allows me to carry on school grounds and signs do not carry the weight of law. And while in college despite being a gun free campus I nearly always had one secured in a case in my backpack; it was against the rules but not illegal.
 ,Tragically stupid
 ,Gun Free? They got shoulder fired missiles and probably multiple rocket launchers hidden underground. Those guys on the roof with binoculars and tripods aren't going to throw rocks at threats.  I was actually surprised a while back when two guys boarded AF1 with M16s in the open. Usually this is done more covertly which may not be a good thing. Leads more dummies like these three.
 ,TIL some people think the White House has no guns.
 ,not all schools are gun free zones but these broads probably don't know that.
 ,They NEVER use facts..NOT EVER
 ,retard
 ,I'll keep asking. Why don't Democrats support having an armed police officer on school property whenever classes are in session? Oh wait thats because it would literally solve the problem.
 ,Once again clear evidence that liberalism is a mental disorder.
 ,That kind of stupid should hurt.
 ,OK to give this person every benefit it's most likely in the context of arming teachers. Or it could be in the context of school shootings. Then she would be saying either: keep guns out of my school or why aren't schools safe places (valid question). Even with those benefits though the Secret Service and Capitol Police are the reasons why guns will never enter the White House. So there is no world where she is right other than the emotional reaction world where she just wants to complain about guns and say that Trump is bad because terrible things happen and its all on him because he is bad and he said he likes the 2nd Amendment so he is bad and h is orange so he is bad.
 ,You should have wrote kinder gardens instead of school.
 ,The white house is not a "public" area; it is the President's official residence.  Everyone can restrict public guns in their home.  It is also filled with security.  People argue against public gun free zones like malls restaurants etc where there is no armed security and anyone can walk in at any time... not the same as the white house or most schools for that matter as schools are not "open to the public" to just come walk around and hangout.
 ,white house is not gun free it's a definite good guys with guns only zone
 ,Even worse whenever you bring up the idea of armed security at schools they  scream and cry that they don't want schools turning into a military base or prison.
 ,Proteck me gubmint! These people are idiots.
 ,"Please tell me this is photoshopped."  /smh
 ,I don't understand how people can be THIS stupid
 ,School are not all fun free zones actually. My school allows concealed carry. Which I’m very happy for!
 ,Retards.
 ,Dumb as shit whores.
 ,All those guys behind them are just trying to get laid but little do they know that those girls are lesbians.
 ,Somehow psycho school shooters are Trumps fault also.  Lol.  These fruitcakes are mentally deranged.
 ,If that was my daughter I would be beyond embarrassed by her behavior.
 ,Or maybe these libtards mean you can't bring your own gun to the WH even if you have CC permit? But can you bring a gun legally to most places of work? I guess laws vary on that. In any case these teen girls shouldn't compare themselves to any US president.
 ,Are those teachers? Fuck.
 ,MODS  !  When POTUS is in London this meme should be PINNED.
 ,When is that knife control gonna stop it?
 ,Lol me too
 ,Oh my sides!
 ,Probably a little low on those numbers
 ,can i have permission to repost this somewhere in the future?
 ,Trump should have purchased that balloon and made it into air blimp one.
 ,Probably a few acid attacks as well
 ,must be a slow day if thats it lol
 ,"I will pretend this city is a mattress in Russia"
 ,Get READY FOR RAMADAN BOMBATHON!!!!
 ,It was a hoax designed to unseat a president.... a coup.
 ,Treasonous coup
 ,Insurance Policy that was instituted by the coup plotters.
 ,To cover up. What if they spied on Trump and others for many years? The Dossier might've been the real insurance policy to give them a reason on why they spied. It was b.s. nontheless but they can somewhat legimitze the spying.
 ,ROSENSTEIN FOR TREASON
 ,We survived the Coup. The tables are turning.
 ,They’re desperate to cover up Obama’s illegal abuse of NSA database queries.  From 2012 onward they surveilled their political opponents.  This was necessary due to IRS surveillance being shut down.  When Holder got the IRS to provide DOJ millions of pages of opposition research that was illegal.  Mueller was Director of FBI then.  Comey was his #2.  They’re guilty and this is their means of avoiding accountability.  Now if they’re prosecuted it’ll look like retribution for the “probe”.  A brilliant strategy maybe.  It can’t be allowed to succeed.
 ,It was a set-up.
 ,#They realized this shitty fake story was their best shot at HARASSING the president. Say it with me folks; PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT.
 ,It's sad that all of this has been reported over and over but we still have to listen to the lefts moving goal post bullshit...If we don't nail them after this God help us!  They will be embolden.
 ,It's all to cover up Obama's illegal FISA abuse to spy on politicians. They used 5 eyes likely UK and Australia to spy on Trump before they got the FISA warrant using fraudulent info and lies. Worse than watergate.
 ,So the Russian meddling in our election is mere conjecture at this point since it was based on a "high to moderate confidence level." WTF.
 ,Clapper looks like an alien.  He needs to go to jail so he can be studied.
 ,Thumbs up to H.A. Goodman. Well done!
 ,Can someone explain to me why Clapper sided with the faggots in the first place?
 ,To interfere in the midterms. The Dem House majority is illegitimate.
 ,They were pissed Comey was fired.
 ,obstruction of justice by firing Comey whom he recommended to Trump to fire.
 ,Justice is coming for these treasonous fuckers.
 ,the whole thing was to preoccupy trump with playing defense and being overly careful so they could run out the clock and get away scott free...they'll string along nonsense for 8 years
 ,I love how the left says “let it go” and “move on” about Benghazi Clinton’s email scandal Bill being a rapist etc but they won’t move on from Russian collusion and obstruction despite irrefutable proof from their boy and his team of angry democrats who combed through every facet of Trump’s life both personal and professional irrefutable proof that neither collusion or obstruction ever took place and they keep saying “dig deeper”. If a former FBI Director and a team of investigators can spend 2 years and over $30m of taxpayer money and NOT find proof to indict how much deeper can they dig? While at it let’s dig deeper on Benghazi Clinton’s emails and now let’s get a special counsel to investigate the origins of this whole BS collusion witch hunt.
 ,The entire two years of the social counsel investigation was spent trying to make a case for obstruction despite the fact that there was no underlying crime. The people responsible for this need to be punished and the tools who still think there is a case for impeachment need to be mocked mercilessly.
 ,\+ fuck up the mid terms
 ,All taxes are excessive.
 ,First they'll say "don't worry bro we just gonna tax the rich to pay for it." Then when someone does the math and realizes that "taxing the rich" will not even begin to cover the cost of these programs they'll just stop talking about how to pay for it all while adding payroll and middle class tax increases in the fine print.
 ,Tax the citizen to pay for immigrants who benefit the most from the free services. They can populate more but we get taxed for it.
 ,Leftism: A plan for everything... and none of it works.
 ,How do you tax UBI?
 ,The original quote "Imagination" also works well here.
 ,How about ending the useless foreign wars which hurt civilians more than the actual enemies?The reason why US is the only developed country lacking these services is because US is also the only country that plays an absurd role as a world police and doesn't really care about its borders. Trillions would be saved for other things.If you have a more nationalist country that doesn't constantly poke other countries you'll be able to take care of your own people. That's logical.
 ,Pretty much we will give 1000 to everyone vote for me!!!!!! We will tax you an additional 1200 to cover the 1000 in fees and to hire more state workers to process the payments!!!!
 ,The plan is using Modern Monetary Theory. Basically it treats the money supply like an MMO economy with the government handing out wads of cash in grants and UBI (sources) and then taxing and fining the shit out of people (sinks).Now riddle me this: name an MMO that used such a command-style economy that had basic money that was worth a shit. You can't because at high level play substitute items always take over since they have more real value to a player than gold ever did.This is what AOC learned in her economics degree from Boston University. It's why when asked how you pay for her batshit crazy ideas she says "you just do".We would be back to a barter economy in months with the USD being worthless.
 ,I want a large family and plenty of time to spend with them.  The democrats seek to deny me of this simple pleasure by making it cost prohibitive through excessive taxation.  These parasites are going to tear the country apart.
 ,Taxation is theft and the American dream is a lie. Even if you work your whole life to pay your house and property off so you can be free of debt and enjoy life the government will come calling and if you refuse they’ll take it. We’re slaves no other way to put it.
 ,How about NO?
 ,If only liberals knew how to cast spells from Trump's magic wand
 ,"Democratic Taxation"
 ,In the end you are left with the taxes as the services degrade over time or are canned.
 ,Even the most excessive taxation wouldn't pay for all this shit. Every dollar in America couldn't pay for it all.
 ,You need an economy to be able to tax people.......You won't have an economy for long under socialism.
 ,Did the founders not put a boot up British asses over this? 200 years sounds like a long time on paper but in reality its a grain of sand.
 ,Why do liberals tax soda? Why do liberal tax cigarettes? Why do liberals tax alcohol? They claim it is to discourage people from engaging in those actions.  If taxing an action discourages people from doing said action what's going to happen when taxes are raised on getting paid.
 ,This is why the Democrats want 16 year olds to vote. Most 16 year olds have never had to pay for anything and probably don't understand income taxes very well.(Not an attack on any 16 year olds reading this)
 ,It doesn't matter how you pay for it.  The point is to purchase the vote not provide accounting details.
 ,I’d argue we are already excessively taxed
 ,Give people who don't want to work money collected from thoughs who do want to work what could possibly go wrong...?
 ,I don’t think you guys realize that excessive taxation < paying for private insurances and tuitions.
 ,The irony is that by purposely not saying “Christians” they have brought more attention to the fact that Muslims massacred Christians.
 ,Libs love Islamists globalism and Socialism. Is there any bigger danger to the USA than voting for a Democrat?
 ,And yet Liberal Christians keep voting for them. Talk about a group of idiots.
 ,What I want to know is how are these guys coordinating their messages. How is it that all high-placed Democrats always have coordinated messages ready to go even using the same key words. Everyone - the elected ones the retired ones and the ones in the media always instantly have coordinated messages.  Who is in charge of telling all these people what to say?
 ,Crooked Hillary like a lot of corrupt American politicians is deep in the pocket of the pious petroleum potentates who profess mindless Mohammadanism. Everywhere the news media is bought out by Islamic interests. Universities use Saudi money to create things like "the Free Speech Project" where Moslem stooges are hired to tell a free people in the United States they are not allowed to say bad things about Islam or Moslems or blaspheme their pernicious Prophet Mohomet. Buggers to that.
 ,More importantly when they talk about praying for or wishing well for victims nothing bad can happen to Christians. They don't want anybody to look at the tweet and go "Oh poor Christians!" On the flipflop bad shit can happen to Muslims. They mention "Muslim" every single time they tweet about some tragedy in regards to Islam.
 ,If normal voters start to ask questions like. "Wait Muslims are killing Christians? Hold on a minute. I'm a Christian. Why are we importing so many Muslims? People that want to kill me?"It's over for them and their movement.So the use terms like Easter Worshippers to fool normal voters into thinking it only happens in some far off land. Yes before you ask. There are lots of people in the world that won't see this.
 ,It's the natural extension of Alinsky's Rules for Radicals. It is important to understand your adversary.
 ,My theory is that the globalists and the dems are using Islam for a “good cop bad cop play” on the western world. They let the Muslims play bad cop when anything jihad related happens while they play good cop. “You better not make him mad...” The whole purpose is to break the spirit of the people and induce them into a kind of Stockholm syndrome to make them compliant and obedient. The left is partaking in a symbiotic relationship with radical Islam. Islam is allowed to spread and the globalists sit on top of a divided and weakened culture.
 ,#CULTURAL MARXISM
 ,This is offensive to cube worshippers.
 ,Is it just me is or is TownHall not loading properly? I've noticed this for the last week or so.
 ,And who's handing out the talking points? They constantly use identical language on the same day media and dems. It's been going on for the last 10-15 YEARS.
 ,Sharia Law but with more steps.  They need those loyal to Allah to replace Christians for their master plan to solve their 'White People Problem'.  Like the 'Jewish Question' that Hitler was faced with.  Seems like a bit of irony....
 ,There are three very bad things that have happened to the United States of America since the year 2000:-The election of President George Bush jr. -9/11-The election of President Barack "censored middle name" Obama
 ,It's "Newspeak".There is great power in words and so they seek to redefine them causing a division between the people that understand the true meaning of the word and those that understand the Newspeak meaning. Never shall they unite as the two sides will not be able to communicate due to Irreconcilable differences in the meaning of words. They want Christ and everyone that follows Him isolated from society. To do that they are going to try and remove the words that identify the concepts from the liberal lexicon. This was the coordinated rollout of another phase of their social engineering plan. Buckle up.
 ,It's simpler than this.The left operates on a victim hierarchy where oppression flows downhill.Islam is below Christianity in the victim hierarchy (because of Bush and Trump and the Crusades 1000 years ago) so they can never be acknowledged as oppressors nor can Christians be acknowledged as victims because victimization only flows downhill not uphill.
 ,I think the rule is actually slightly different. Its nothing Christians/White people do can be promoted as good. And nothing Christians/White people experience can be experienced as bad or a hardship. Makes it quite easy to see how demonrats will respond when framed in this manner.
 ,Revealed Obama has someone else tweeting for him. Not a surprise. Teleprompter-in-chief never wrote a thing for the Harvard Law Review either but took the title as the head of the organization.
 ,> Essentially the left's rule is that nothing bad -- no matter how true -- may be said about Muslims or Islam and nothing good -- no matter how true -- may be said of Christians or Christianity. but why?
 ,This scares me.
 ,THE SADDEST THING I'VE HEARD ALL WEEK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HOW DOES A PEDE RE?  I'M RE'ING OVER ALL THIS...
 ,Because they are anti-Christian...
 ,They were essentially calling Christians Pagans i.e. hypocrites  in order to delegitimize Christianity as a religion. The attacks on the churches and the fear mongering by the MSM is intended to instill fear and doubt in weaker Christians to avoid places of worship. What people need to focus on is that of the three semitic religions —Judaism Christianity and Islam— this is only ever done to Christianity.
 ,Ugh. How about you stop giving a fuck what these morons say? Anti American liars say disgusting stuff? Color me shocked. Fuck everyone seems more concerned with the language known traitors use than the victims of the attack.
 ,Disgusting people all of them.
 ,These messages are tailored to their base who do not want to be told that Christians have been attacked by Muslims.  They want to hear that Muslims have been attacked by Christians because it fits their worldview.
 ,This world would be better off without Islam.  That’s a fact.
 ,They were making fun of the people who were killed! You get that right? HRC and BHO are the actual Easter Worshippers! They worship Satan and therefore Ishtar Mother Earth. Where Easter originates. HRC has been practicing witchcraft for at least 40 years. It's part of her bio. In books written about her and Bill.
 ,There’s a deeper explanation: They call us Christians Easter worshippers because (many of us) out of ignorance don’t realize that Easter means Ishtar and is a pagan holiday in honor of a pagan god. The satanic elite understand that those who worship their pagan gods even unknowingly are subject to them and therefore legitimate targets for satanic ritual sacrifice of which this bombing was an example. God says “my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.”
 ,I do wonder when and what will spark "Hockey mask time"?
 ,Good thing we're still around to say fuck islam fuck Mohamhead and fuck his followers.
 ,Holy shit he looks bad. Bill too!
 ,Wondering if Bill is stoned or catatonic.  He always seems to have that expression.  Also having famously gone vegan is that a leather jacket?  Inquiring minds want to know....
 ,When you drop acid and wander the fairgrounds
 ,Hard to believe that this was probably the most powerful couple in the world!
 ,Tbh Bill has a nice Jacket
 ,I'm getting more of an Austin Powers vibe from Hill Pill....
 ,She looks like Brick Top.
 ,Why is just about every picture of him with his mouth hanging open.  Even during McCain's funeral the mouth just hung open like a venus fly trap.
 ,You would think with all their money they'd be able to idk not be half dead?  Bill is a walking corpse and Hillary is just fat and looking like a man.
 ,Are those the anti-seizure glasses?
 ,"Wow man this is good shit I've been tripping balls since '69!  I was a dog who could fly then I was President.  It all seemed so real then you were gonna be President too and that's when I knew I was trippin and none of it was happening.  Is Woodstock over yet?"
 ,Bill needs a chin strap.
 ,i'm sensing a dowager dragon empress of china vibe in her sartorial choices...
 ,Dead people walking......
 ,AIDS is kicking Bill's ass.  He used to be so vibrant and full of life.  Now he is just a walking corpse.
 ,Man I would really love to punch both of them in the face.
 ,I didn’t think Segal was doing that bad that he had to auction his wardrobe...
 ,The Walking Dead makeup department really outdid themselves last season...
 ,Kiss it Bill.
 ,Bills saying... Oh look a kiddie park!
 ,Bill is amazed that she can still walk on her own
 ,There are so many funny memes posted on this subreddit. They should be cross-shared with r/funny.
 ,Bill is in Lala land. What kind of disease does he have? He looks horrible.
 ,Almost never see those two together.
 ,mouth breather
 ,f'ing savage man....just savage
 ,So true
 ,Hold hands you fake-o’s.
 ,Bill looking real ghoulish.
 ,Bill is a Members Only(r) guy. No members for Hillsbian.
 ,You'll be hard pressed to find a picture of Bill from the last 10 years without his slack jawed mouth agape. He looks like he's had a lobotomy.
 ,This map is incorrect. Oklahoma is the only state that went completely red in 2016. This one has like 8
 ,This map is not correct.  Cali and Texas has more blue counties at the border on the actual map
 ,This is not accurate.  I live in Chicago.  Trump didn't win the collar counties.
 ,This is one of the (many) failings of not teaching civics & government in schools anymore. Younger generations don't understand how and why a Constitutional Republic works. But by all means let's get those Islam and transgender classes in the schools! Far more important.
 ,This Map is wrong. Here is the correct one[2016 by county](https://i.imgur.com/O2eXIt8.png)
 ,Look at Hawaii... what a crap shoot. Let’s fly the immigrants there.
 ,Yeah this map is wrong in a lot of areas. The county I live in definitely went blue but shows red on this map. Let’s not engage in this same shut that the libs do.
 ,Our cities are infested
 ,If Dems had their way they would only campaign in LA and NYC prisons.
 ,It’s clear that this is fake lol.
 ,Hypotetical question what hapoens if 95% of people live in 1 - 5 state and the other 5% spread across the other states? Say the 95% state votes for party A and the other states allvote for party B.According to electoral college party B would win right? but 95% of people voted for party A?Is there a rule/clause for this would there have to be a change in voting system? How would that be worked out?
 ,I see why leftists are so worried about global warming now– all their shit is coastal lmao.
 ,Map is wrong. Please make sure it’s correct before posting. It’s not hard to get something off a quick search
 ,That map shows you the travel corridors of illegal immigrants and communist university strongholds in plain sight
 ,My area in central PA went blue. Who made this?
 ,Leans into mic *
 ,Dems are takers Reps are givers it’s a constant balance between the two. What Dems don’t realize is if they win and create a society of takers all that red will stop producing what those cities need. The whole system will fail. Reps want the blue to work hard and be self-sustaining while giving a fair shake to the red. That’s how you create a prosperous society. It’s too bad so many people think we need their tech and apps more than they need our food and produce.
 ,Erie County ( NW PA ) was Red.... this map has it blue =(
 ,Electoral don't exactly fix the problem because its based at senator (2) + house of representatives (based at population) to totally fix the problem it would need to be based at voters that went to vote.
 ,The spoiled people in city's think everyone else in the country as slaves who deliver their Starbucks & Avocados.
 ,Cockroaches nest together
 ,Can someone just redo this map all red please?
 ,We need to get busy that map has way too much blue.
 ,What is happening is that we are seeing how deep this problem goes.  We have politicians on both sides of the aisle that have sold our country's sovreignity to Mexico.
 ,didnt some mexican "military members" disarm US Troops at the border?
 ,Cartels or heavily armed coyotes.

 ,Hi CIA!
 ,This is outrageous. Automatic asylum denial if you have a squadron of armed guards to bring you here.
 ,We're being invaded. They have conquered entire cities and states without firing a single bullet and we let them.
 ,Our military is deployed all over the world to protect other countries and their borders...but it’s a “huge problem” to expect them to defend our borders.  Utter bullshit!
 ,[removed]
 ,Is that kidnapping?
 ,Where's our marksmen at?
 ,Seems like one side is already at war. Drone strikes please.
 ,We don’t need to ask questions like we don’t know. Better to correctly call it an invasion.
 ,"Nothing is going on. There is no crisis. Ignore what you are seeing and hearing on other channels. Everything that really happens you'll hear from us"-CNN probably
 ,Well when an **armed** US militia starts to defend themselves against an invasion guess what ensues?
 ,Cartels are getting paid to smuggle ppl across.
 ,So it seems that Militia in New Mexico is needed after all.  This is a direct threat to our freedom when people are entering illegally under armed escort.  I believe the term for this is invasion.
 ,Gangs armed by Obama's #Fast and Furious
 ,They spelled slavery wrong.These are slaves.
 ,It's almost like cartels are profiting off illegal immigration.
 ,The Mexican military has been aiding drug cartels for years. This isn’t new.
 ,So it is an invasion. Military on the border A10 the crossers.
 ,Are they crossing into the US or into Mexico?
 ,Yeah... that’s been happening down here for years.
 ,Cartel smuggling.. bad hombre's are loaded with AK-47's
 ,Cattle ranches have more secure fences than the border of our country. WTF?
 ,This is nothing new.
 ,DO SOMETHING TRUMP!
 ,Sooooo......our National Guard is currently not armed on the border?
 ,Libs: OMG it's so dangerous for them they need armed escorts. We must help them!!!
 ,Those are all 2020 Democrat voters. That precious commodity needs an escort. We might want to dig out Barry's predator drones.
 ,Probly fucking cia escorting in future "terrorists."
 ,> homophobic  racist and violent attackThey are all black how would this be racist?One engaged in sex acts with Smollet.  What a homophobe!
 ,A week ago or so Smollett made some remark about filing suit against CPD.  Anyone else hear that?
 ,> Earlier this month Smollett was sent a $130000 city bill to reimburse the cost of the seven-day investigation into his assault claims. The actor refused to pay and is now facing a lawsuit from the city to recoup the costs plus damages.Ha!
 ,I hope  if smollet  goes to jail he doesnt drop the soap
 ,Wait one of them sexually assaulted him during the attack? This whole thing just gets more and more confusing. And I'll bet that's by design.
 ,If these guys were white they would be toast by now. Even if they merely happen to be on the same block as the attack.And Jussie would go along with the whole thing.The guy is scum
 ,They participated in a hate crime aimed at generating even more violence from the Africans against white men.  Good chance they do hate white men.
 ,They hated white people enough to take money to villify them with a hatecrime hoax.
 ,HOMOPHOBICENGAGED IN SEX ACTSThey better win this fucking lawsuit. I'm rooting for them. I know they planned a hoax but for THEM to be the patsies and smollett to get away is abhorrent.
 ,Bet anyone here five dollars this lawsuit of theirs is paid for by Smollett's team/Chicago insiders somehow in order to both blow smoke and confuse the issue.  Hiring a bunch of actors to accuse each other of nonsense is a great ploy - their profession is to make a script look realistic after all.
 ,They need new friends
 ,They are Nigerian. They could never go back if they allow these claims to stand.
 ,Like the NLC meme this stupid fucking clown world won't stop being true.
 ,Lol... this is spinning out of control. So Jussie paid him for sex?
 ,What a chump.
 ,🤡 🌎
 ,Racist..........?If it was true. Two black people attacked another black person.......So not a racist attack.Also I never heard about him (Smollett) being raped. This got thrown out of court? Clown world confirmed.
 ,The plot thickens
 ,Why do they keep calling them Nigerians? They were born in Chicago.
 ,They need to sue for millions
 ,Jessie should really have just stayed home that night....what a dishrag.
 ,I'm surprised anyone could get it up during that polar vortex.
 ,sad honk...
 ,I immediately think of that Curb Your Enthusiasm song when I think of Smollet.
 ,Amusing. If I had sex with a woman and she attacked me wearing blackface I think that I would know if she were black or not.
 ,Yes. All of this will never be as fun again. And all of this will never be as personal for me.Its been beyond amazing. Watching this guy get slammed over and over again by all the forces we hate and then watching him win those Republican debates win the nomination win the debates with his "You'd be in jail." line and then in the face of 65% 85% 98% for Hillary he wins the race. The man is just goddamn refreshing. We need this as a country. Certain people in this place have gotten too high and mighty too disconnected from reality preaching ideologies that don't make any sense at all. Trump ran on reality TPTB run on denying it as much as they can. It was so beautiful to see him win. I prayed for him. I wanted him badly to win. Obama's second term was one of the worst stretches of my life with the last six months before Election Night being the worst stretch of them all. I was stuck in a far off city for half a decade; I was broke broken as a person isolated miserable. The few friends I had were not really my friends. If nothing else the beating Trump was taking from everyone in the universe was something I could relate to. Its amazing that I'm still around on this Earth considering how far down in a bad place I was. But Trump was there too. On Election Night I was in a stoned and drunk stupor watching the results come in by myself in my apartment. I passed out with the TV on. There is no memory of where I passed out or how far into everything it was. And I woke up to Trump winning Pennsylvania. I think I missed the entire night except for the very best part. And I rejoiced. I cried tears of joy. I jumped up and down in my bedroom and had to nearly strangle myself to stop from cheering. I had prayed and believed and predicted against just about everyone and everything I knew and I had been right all along. Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming that something so off the wall awesome and cool could happen and that there were millions that felt and hope just like I did.Three weeks after Trump won I left. I went to a new corner of the country. Went from a major major blue city with millions of people to red-state small town America over a thousand miles away. Everything got better. I mean everything.
 ,More terrified than sad. He's the only thing between us - a tyranny and world government.
 ,I watched Trump win on the TV in my office above a gay LGBT night club I worked at. They had a viewing party and any time Hillary won a state everyone would roar so loudly I could easily hear it over the music. Moods were extremely high until they realized Trump won. I walked downstairs and everyone was crying as if they lost a child. Good news was that we were going to sell a shit ton of alcohol no matter who won/lost. I also won $200 that night. Hehe.
 ,2025*We’ll get 19.5 days in 2025.
 ,I am sad that the Republicans will only have some weak limp wristed globalist neocon Democrat submissive selected for a replacement. I hope The Donald hand picks a successor.
 ,He’s not a bastard he’s a Family man.
 ,Do you realy have to remind me....  It's like reminding someone that they are going to die
 ,I wish it were possible to reset the clock back to 2016 and give this man back the two years that wretched Hillary and her taint-licking sycophants stole from him but I know better. Despite all the ridiculous bullshit Trump has worked at his normal pace something that has never been understood in the 20hr a week ClownWorld known as Congress. I’m good with that.Pedes enjoy this time in your life. Enjoy the good laughs you get from memes TrumpTweets™️ salty tears and media meltdowns. More importantly live your life and spend time with those most important to you. The Left is trying their hardest to make this a miserable time something they do every time a conservative is in office however this time it’s both left and right. Don’t fall for the media’s bullshit don’t fall for your municipality’s bullshit. They only focus on the negative (tent cities “starving” children etc) only when a conservative is in office and memory-hole them when a leftist is in office. Remember: eternal victims like the left remain in survivor mode the rest of their life and seek to recruit others to that mindset. We choose life we choose living. We don’t carry our kids full term so that they can survive we bring them into this world so they can live.
 ,It’s ok Alex Jones will get elected after him #Jones2024
 ,Wait untill he's left office. Then the fun really begins. Haha
 ,Yes.  I am scared about the future of the country after he leaves.
 ,Desantis 2024
 ,It’s a crazy thing to think that he’ll be able to make it 8 years under such abuseIt amazes me he has made it this longI’m a young healthy fella and I doubt I could still be going as strong as himGod Save God Emperor Trump!
 ,I’m terrified they will steal the election in 2020 and go full fucking insane with gun grabbing open boarders and freedom destroying
 ,I think it would be great to have Nikki Haley take over after Trump’s second term.  The other side would implode because the republicans would have the first female President who is also a first generation American.  She is also a strong badass that has called out the hypocrisy in other nations.
 ,I fucking love Trump.
 ,Kinda sad? I'm damned worried for the USA and the world!
 ,On the night of the election I was at a star studded Hollywood election party doing my best to look happy then concerned then deeply troubled then horrified as the Orange Man Bad took state after state. As the night wore on the stars left and it was just me and an open bar. I ordered a double Johnny walker blue on the tab of (insert famous Hollywood person) and cracked a single smile. It was one of the best nights of my life
 ,I just hope people will not vote democrat after he is done and the republican party will have a competent player2016 was a joke and a shitshow apart from Trump everyone was a vapid hollow of a fart
 ,Yes... a little concerned what we have left to choose from in 2024... maybe one of the kids will run (I would still vote for Pence but I'm not sure he's got the personality to win)...
 ,I am but he is teaching us to win. It's absolutely amazing what he has survived and endured and who comes next knows they will need the winning Lion spirit to prevail.
 ,It makes me sad but also nervous. He’s the only man stopping this country from going full blown socialism that the left supports.
 ,Feels bad man (sadpepe.jpg)
 ,Trump has to destroy them to protect his grand kids
 ,Can he be Pence's vice president in 2024?
 ,My hopes is that when he leaves office our US government is not the center of our lives and thing upon which money healthcare jobs fees and taxes all hinge upon and make large impacts on our life. I hope government moves into the realm of being mostly irrelevant in the day to day lives of people. Low or no taxes low or no fees low regulation no wrangling of authority over things such as health care.&#x200B;Build roads provide the military basic services. Lower the burden on the people and stop being a part of my life government and taxes.&#x200B;Hopefully we reach that point by the time Trump leaves office and hopefully that form of government is restored to the USA.
 ,Maybe the Trumpster has someone in mind for us that we havent thought of yet!
 ,I'm still hopeful that Don Jr. might run later!  It won't be quite the same but it will still be great!  (Make The Future Great Again!)
 ,I can't think about it.  It's too depressing.  I'm too busy enjoying my MAGA high.  Why are you harshing my mellow?
 ,2025! Don’t cut it short!
 ,We should amend the Constitution so Trump can have a third and fourth term.
 ,According to liberals he will never leave tho
 ,hopefully Trump will use his apprentice skills to find a proper replacementTrump isn't a cuck he'll handpick his replacement and back them in the primary to the max.
 ,We’re going to elect Don Jr. then.
 ,Jan 2025.
 ,But 2024 is so soon 😫
 ,I’m gonna say it. I want him to run again in 2024 and I want them to amend the constitution to allow it.
 ,Given who is waiting in the wings on the left I'd say I'm more scared than sad. Trump's election is the only thing that prevented the US from becoming European Caliphate 2.0.
 ,Immigrate here please.
 ,Lamenting begins when his eight years as President is over until then rejoice and carry-on!!!
 ,From Canada: We had just been defeated a year prior in the Canadian election and we had a year of Mr. Peoplekind.&#x200B;I knew Trump would win provided it was a fair election. I did not have hopes of it being fair. I expected Hillary to win by like 2% and then the Media was going to circle the wagons for her. Then.... at around 1am that election night Trump had basically won with a landslide. &#x200B;Man I pumped my fists in the air!!! and from then on my journey from atheism back to God started again.
 ,Pretty much since day 1. But if he can set up a worthy successor the good times can continue.
 ,It will be similar to when Robin Williams stepped away from the mic in “Good Morning Vietnam”
 ,##Who the fuck are you to call him bastard? ##HE IS GEOTUS##FUCK OFF
 ,We have other people out there that would be great replacements for Trump after he's gone in 2024 but we have to be careful to choose the correct guy. I'm hoping Ron DeSantis is considering a run for president in the future.
 ,I refuse to think about it.
 ,I think of this more than I probably should.
 ,The Regressive non-Liberal Left only knows how to fail. They've wasted the last 3 years on self-destruction. The more they talk the sooner they all hogtie themselves. Truths have come to light on a steady stream while they expose themselves for the losers dividers and haters they are. People have been leaving the Dem party in droves beginning with Dems for Trump during the last election. Independents have zero reasons to vote for Dems. And * Brad Parscale is President Trump's campaign manager this time around.
 ,I hope trump Jr. take over in 2024
 ,Hopefully we will have learned how to stand up for our selves by then.
 ,I’m scared that someone might get through security and harm him.  I live near the white house and I see his increased security.  Simultaneously I’m relieved he has such good security but also it seems like they regularly get threats and beef up security.
 ,IM CRYING 😭
 ,I just hope the next Prez doesn’t just undo all he did.
 ,I'm hoping by 2024 the world will have woken up and we will have another Republican president that is even more based than Trump.
 ,The thought of this makes me so triggered right now.  I’m literally shaking.
 ,Ideally Pence will get elected in 2024 and Trump will be his vice nothing would make me happier than 16 years of pepe memes and triggering liberals
 ,Yes that’s why there’s Don Jr.
 ,What a beautiful man.
 ,that is the glorious thing about America. We have a memelord in the Whitehouse but we aren't stingy. We want the whole world to enjoy his antics right along with us. It's pretty much a surefire way to determine how much fun they are at a party. If they can't laugh along when trump trolls they are probably a stick in the mud. Works on every continent I have been to in the last several years
 ,I own a factory in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and go there once per year to see new R&D ideas and to "keep face" with our factory personnel.&#x200B;Furthermore my mother set up a cruise with my sister her family and I in the Mediterranean in the summer of 2016 during the election.&#x200B;During all of my trips over seas I heard FAR MORE enthusiasm for Trump than against him.  The news and media tries to lie like usual but the truth is definitely not what they are saying.&#x200B;Progressives are going down the world over as more and more people see them as authoritarians bent on controlling everything they do.
 ,We are witnessing and living through the biggest scandal in American history.  And it all started with one crooked woman who always got her way. Damned everything and everybody else. Money corrupts not just their being but their soul too. Once on a roll they're hooked. One last roll of the dice. Too many recovered gamblers will tell you that they felt invincible "It's always one last time. Then you lose everything". When this is all behind us and the dust settles there's GOING to be a Feature Movie made to cement this story in time and history. Our children and grandchildren and into the future people will watch this movie and think "Wow! That  poor guy"! "That evil Bitch"! Those corrupt people who are supposed to be the good guys".  The Bitch could easily have lost with dignity and take her "Foundation money" that was stolen bribed and swindled and just bought an island to retire to. All those MILLIONS. And she COULD HAVE gotten away with it all. If she didn't roll the dice "one last time".
 ,Rand Paul/Dan Crenshaw 2024!
 ,Yeah and who will take over?
 ,Don't think of it that way he's inspired so many other  Patriots. Basic principles.
 ,Sad that a unique truly fascinating historical figure will be moving on yes.  But I think he'll leave us with a suitable successor ...won't be Pence
 ,8 years (*4 years at a time*) that's it. I expect him to leave when that is completed. Technically it will be Jan 2025 so we got that to look forward too!He's been a GREAT President and has made me happy to have him leading our country. MAGA!!!! And THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP! :)
 ,The greatest president of my life time - I am not even kidding.
 ,My hero.
 ,He gets two year tacked on the end by default because of the baseless uniparty false charges.
 ,the best thing i've ever seen in politics in all my 54 years  i hope he gets the chance to complete his and his teams work
 ,[removed]
 ,Don’t use foul language to describe my beautiful president.
 ,No
 ,They sure do Cher. Now why don't you use this opportunity to really look at the other shit your party supports. You may find you aren't on the side that supports your beliefs.
 ,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
 ,One coat please. Someone has taken the red pill.
 ,Incoming reeeeeeing over "red pilling"
 ,So cher is about to get institutionalized lol
 ,That's the only outcome of a culture that has to constantly push boundaries and for which enough is never enough. Everyone has a limit. Even the craziest crazy on their side will one day hit a point where they have to stop and say "woah wait maybe we shouldn't go *that* far." The more they push the more people don't feel welcome anymore.There were 10 in the bed and the little one said "death row convicts and terrorists should be allowed to vote" so they all rolled over and Cher fell out.
 ,Mike Rowe to Cher : "Right about now I bet you are wishing you took the BLUE pill."  Rowe needs to come out for one side or the other.  He smells a bit of a socialist rat like Cypher in the Matrix movie
 ,Somebody get Cher a coat.
 ,Batshit Bernie is the anti-hero we need right now.  Thank you Slanders for red-pilling the SJW queen!
 ,So far left that she went right
 ,Someone give this woman a brick !
 ,Cher is still awful. According to her Twitter yesterday she "rather be dead than red". I think she is in the midst of some programming errors.
 ,womp womp!
 ,*If I could turn back time**I'd give my vote to you!*Cher now probably.
 ,> He is fighting every day to protect the people from thugs crossing the border.She's not wrong
 ,“President Trump contacts underage girl house screams to impeach!” ~Legacy Media
 ,sweet letter
 ,Trumps message to this girl:“I was honored to learn that you selected me as your hero for a school project” the president wrote. “Your heartfelt and longstanding support means a great deal to me.“I am proud of you for standing up for yourself. Everyone deserves to receive the same care and respect we give ourselves” he continued. “I encourage you to always be yourself and keep making your voice heard. There is no one else like you and our country’s bright future relies upon your leadership!”&#x200B;This is what leadership looks like by the girl and our President.  &#x200B;Well done to you both.
 ,Wow. I love that he sent her a real letter instead of tweeting at her parents. And the “God bless you” at the end. An American hero.
 ,This young girl will continue to fight for what she believes in especially after being recognized by the President! President Trump loves America!
 ,What a nice man.
 ,2012- “you got a letter from Obama? Way to go! A+!”2019- “you got a letter from Trump? You racist little s**t!”
 ,Best.  President.  Ever.
 ,Biden follows up with a house visit to said girl
 ,Trump really does care.  He really does.
 ,Gotta love that name. Bella Moscato has to be a brand of wine lol
 ,Now that teacher just made Trump a hero to her entire class.  Liberals always be shooting themselves in the foot.
 ,I’m starting to get the feeling that Italian Americans are the most based Americans.
 ,Just fire those teachers...
 ,>Donald Trump is fighting thugs coming across the borderThis girl definitely does not have a soy dad.
 ,Not even close to peak.Honk honk fren.
 ,[VERY FRIGGIN COOL!!!!](https://twitter.com/valeracci?lang=en)
 ,Teacher should be fired. We need to start clearing out these maniacs
 ,I remember an interview with an editor or writer at the onion and he said they wen through a period where they had a hard time coming up with parodies because the real sites kept running similar stories to their parody ones.
 ,*Honk*
 ,Hahahahaha
 ,You know the shit has hit the fan when The Onion's headlines make sense.
 ,I wish it was nothing but it's usually a net negative.
 ,The satire part is they didn't actually announce it. The truth is they still do nothing.
 ,Sometimes they are spot on lol!
 ,Sometimes reality is the best satire
 ,since when is paul krugman a new columnist?
 ,Womp womp
 ,>Will Contribute Nothing To SocietyThat was a big reason I decided not to study journalism years ago.   Boy was that a good decision.
 ,Kind of like when Chelsea Clinton got paid $600k/year to 'work' for NBC?
 ,The Left uses The Onion as a manual
 , Wow she flipped on that quick... it's almost like she just a parrot and none of her words/beliefs are honest.
 ,She got the poll numbers so now she has an answer.
 ,"It's a conversation we need to have" No... it's not.They are slingin' shit to see what sticks. What a sad way to search out a platform.
 ,They need things to run on so they are floating out these crazy policies to see if any will stick. Just shows that they lack a plan.
 ,At this point they are just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. There doesn't seem to be anything of substance except these far left plans for reparations daconian gun control and taxpayer funded... everything. It's like they are all trying to outdo each other for the most exteme positions possible.
 ,She flips faster than she flops.
 ,Too bad idiot voters will fall for free shit!
 ,Next thing you know she’ll want to form a government agency to pick and choose which felons can and cannot vote.
 ,This will kill Bernie if it comes up in the debates
 ,This cunt is the reason Californians cant buy any handgun made after 2000 because they dont have "micro stamping" technology. Guess what?  It doesn't fucking exist. Fuck her. Bitch
 ,its almost like these idiots are beta testing ideas in real time.  If they are trying to find whats popular they will be shocked when they sound exactly like the sitting president when they are done.
 ,I feel that Bernie is just being used as the test cuck for the upcoming primaries."People like you for some reason. Say this about murderers and see how they respond so we can craft our responses to whatever is liked most."Once again Bernie is someone's bitch.
 ,Democrat politicians are proud they have more in common with prisoners than they have with normal working Americans. Maybe it's the fact they both make a living stealing from the same taxpayers.
 ,Heels up... Top KEK
 ,Oops the wind shifted!
 ,This is their new "moderate"
 ,Unbelievable to see how crazypants and self destructive the democratic party has become. A thoughtful 12 year old could design a better strategy.
 ,She zigs!  She zags! She flips!  She flops! She sucked Willie Brown’s cock!
 ,She sucks. So does Pocahontas.
 ,They have 0 narrative no platform  nothing positive going for them.NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA HEY HEY HEY GOODBYE!
 ,God I cannot wait for the Demo primary debates
 ,Well that was a quick "conversation".
 ,Conversation over?
 ,I can't believe that fascist and crooked prosecutor Kamala Harris is working even harder to disenfranchise victims of the judicial system.
 ,we gotta go on twitter and talk about how there are actual Nazi's and skinheads in prison and that would mean they would now have the right to vote.
 ,Stealing that name 😂😂
 , She's not necessarily flip-flopping she's A-B testing. Kamala is smart. Plus I hear she gives great head.
 ,I give it a couple days for her base to have the shakes. Minor at first before they get to the highs.
 ,I want a career where I can start on my knees and eventually work my way on to my back.  This girl has it down.
 ,"Wait which way are they voting...  Alright I'll go with that"
 ,Good thing she regained her commonsense. I heard that she was quite tough on crime.
 ,Slut can't make up it's mind. What a surprise.
 ,Can you imagine being so dumb that this wasn't your initial opinion?  How stupid can you be?
 ,IE "I dont have actual beliefs of my own I just say what I think people want to hear."
 ,Too late bitch. That's like saying "Nevermind I don't think we should legalize murder."You're done kiddo you blew it. Pun very much intended.
 ,So out of touch with the world that she's flipping because it's what she thinks people want to hear.Pathetic.
 ,She flipped her position even quicker whenever Willie Brown asked...
 ,I find her unlikable. Her look her voice her laugh her pandering her past etc.
 ,Dems are just flavor of the day whores.  No real thoughts or opinions.
 ,What’s everyone else think?...... I change my answer! ........Yes! That is bad!
 ,Say anything she can to get what she wants.
 ,Amazing what polling data does when you have no original ideas or moral convictions.
 ,It must be strange to have no moral compass.
 ,Changes her tune every day
 ,WE SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION FIRST
 ,Uh oh NPCs having different opinions?&#x200B;The mob must rule with a uniform programming.  So will Bernie backtrack too or will Kamala be scarified?
 ,What casual voter is going to think that giving criminals the right to vote from jail is a good idea?No one is. Once a person has served their time? Fine. Death sentence and true lifers will never finish their time. So they don't get to vote.  This is one issue that will cross the lines with moderate voters. Both sides would agree. But when you talk about the far left crazies? Anything is up for grabs. Bunch of fucking clowns.
 ,See this is what happens when you just say whatever to get elected rather than have a set of principles you are running on.
 ,Wow that was one helluva fast "conversation"!
 ,What a Fascist White Supremacist
 ,Why don't democrat try it with their primaries?
 ,How do these people even manage to stand without a spine? Must be the stick up their arse.When people flip like that it shows that they have no principles. And you don't want people without principles anywhere near positions of power.  They don't stand for anything (for again they have no spine) and just say what people want to hear as long as it gets them to where they want to be meaning that this position itself is what they crave the most. Makes you think "What for?" and that's a very good fucking question.
 ,What wont she say to be elected?
 ,Another trial balloon shot down.  Rather than actual real policies to help Americans democrats just fling shit to see what will stick to the walls.  How this one even made it out of committee demonstrates just how out of touch the democrats really are.But then I'd expect nothing less from the party of crime.
 ,HEELS UP DON’T VOTE
 ,Sorry but if you’re behind bars you should be stripped of certain rights and one is voting.  To me if you’re there you have failed society and should be punished by losing rights that law abiding citizens have.
 ,I love when I get asked why I call her "heels up"
 ,She sealed her fate with her talk of using an EO to take away gun rights.
 ,Her heels are up and she's wearing flip flops.
 ,At least she's consistent...??
 ,I hope she wins the primary. Hillary 2.0 without the name recognition
 ,“Heels up” is soooo funny!! Whore!hahahaha
 ,I will never understand why Democrats fight so hard for all of the evil and bad people in the world like terrorists thugs gangbangers and all other manner of degenerates. If only they fought half as hard for law-abiding Americans.
 ,Crawfished like a motherfucker lolol
 ,These power-hungry monsters want to decide who gets to vote and who doesn't.  Never mind the fucking Constitution.
 ,Did these idiot Dems finally look at the poll numbers for that insane position.  They sure as heck don't have opinions of their own.  It must have been backlash from thier own constituents that made her do a 180.  Even ditzzy Cher was screaming about it how bad an idea it was.
 ,She realized her and Bernie were being set up to throw the primary.
 ,She starting her flipping job early I see.
 ,This karma whore here
 ,These dipshits have no principles or integrity  whatsoever. They will say or do anything to anyone at anytime if it gets them power.
 ,They have no platform. Just whatever they think people want to hear.
 ,All of the swamp creatures are worried about losing their voting rights when they get locked up.
 ,She had a conversation with her handlers None if the D’s Do well outside their own regional bubbles
 ,I personally think votes are for the people who form the civilisation and community. They should together vote for what the country is going to do next.  Criminal scum is not part of that so why should they get to vote?
 ,**In some deep dark dungeon / DNC Command center located under a pizza parlor.....**&#x200B;"OK lets float this trial balloon and see how the media and public like the idea of getting felons vote.

 ,At a certain age Kids should be informed of this reality by their parents about how wrong demented and fucked up it is. So that they know that it is dangerous. it is not an orientation. It’s a demonic influence that doesn’t need tolerance or be discussed lightly. Pedos and beastiality necrophiliacs need to be locked up permanently.

 ,#THE ONLY GOOD PEDO IS A DEAD PEDO.Pedophilia is NOT an orientation. It is a developed fetish an adult acquires for the power exerted over a child. It is a developed fetish for the suffering of children. It is a developed fetish for the morally depraved and socially unacceptable. Go ahead and argue genetics or abuse in childhood all you want. It's a cop out and WRONG. Your genetics and upbringing can load the gun but your decisions pull the trigger.These subhuman pieces of shit make the choices they do and they deserve nothing but a death penalty for it. I have zero sympathy for any of them or their enablers.
 ,Do they teach rape in high school? That's been a part of history.
 ,I'm in CA with my first child on the way.  It's either Private school or home school 100%.  It's clown world ground zero here.  We don't have to tolerate it.  These people are cowards.  Confront them and tell them no.
 ,Originally homosexuality was the act of having sex with someone of the same gender.  It has been changed over time into an uncontrollable desire to have sex with someone of the same gender.  No normal person wants to think about 2 dudes having sex but if they can't help themselves then they become sympathetic.This normalization of pedophilia is following the same recipe.  First they change the definition of the word from being the act of raping a child to being the uncontrollable desire to rape a child.  Of course the term pedophile -- a lover of children is already a marketers dream because calling it what it is child rape would never be sympathetic.

 ,lolI'm totally sure they're totally bots guys. Surely real people weren't discussing the Mueller report they were told not to!
 ,Wish I were fly on wall with Jack Dorsey meeting..... “Hey Jack why are you screwing with the Republicans?????
 ,I was one of those bots Twitter now wants my mobile phones number to reactivate my account. Fuck you Twitter it was nice knowing you.  spez1: [proof](http://magaimg.net/img/7tnu.png)
 ,Before I got banned from Twitter for making my account an NPC I was twice suspended for activity that was suspicious for automation (botting).The first time was after I made the account and followed Trump and a handful of conservatives. I guess that's how they define a bot.
 ,When will Reddit remove the liberal bots?
 ,Meanwhile liberal bots flourish
 ,Did Jack do that on his way in or out of the mtg yesterday
 ,5000 pro trump bots == real people who are guilty of wrongthink
 ,He hasn’t won 2020 until he wins it. Until then get your lowers gentlemen. If Dems win Congress and the White House the 2nd Amendment will be dismantled.
 ,Any guess as to how many of those bots are not bots but actual conservatives falsely flagged as bots.
 ,I thought the CEO was in the Whitehouse a day or two ago? What was that even for.
 ,Why do we care? Fuck TwitterGab is so much better
 ,Looks like yesterday’s meeting with Dorsey was super effective.  /s
 ,Bots are annoying as fuck on twitter they should be banned left or right
 ,Ask them how many pro socialist bots and pro anything else Democrats they have closed in the last few years. Doubt they ever do it.
 ,Don't ever get too comfortable and please go out and vote. We saw the reddest state in the union Alabama vote for a Democratic senator.Georgia and Florida came inches from having radical leftist governors. Trump needs us to do a better job of getting out to vote. Jeff Sessions seat should never have went to a democrat.
 ,100000 socialist bots still going strong in /r/politics.
 ,And it's still ongoing. They have not stopped their coup attempt. The full force and power of the law needs brought down on all their heads.
 ,It's what the FBI does best. They have a limited bag of tricks which are mostly hey let's go talk to someone and see if we can get them on record of a timeline of events from years ago. Oh boy. The guy said something happened on July 26th and it was actually the July 23rd. Offer a deal to make stuff up on his boss or we will charge for lying to big daddy government. Meanwhile actual criminals can't be caught cause the criminal cops are busy playing politics.
 ,100%.It was falsified evidence and nefarious people used to make the appearance of collusion look legit.
 ,I just bought Deep State Target by George Papadopoulos. He was just on Fleccas Talks and I never realized how insane and far-reaching this situation is
 ,AG Barr must get to the bottom (or start) of this entire shytestorm.   "...on April 24 2016. Over breakfast in a London hotel a Maltese academic named Joseph Mifsud allegedly told Papadopoulos a volunteer adviser with the Trump campaign that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton".[https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2018/06/25/the\_mysterious\_seven\_preludes\_of\_the\_fbis\_trump-russia\_probe.html](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2018/06/25/the_mysterious_seven_preludes_of_the_fbis_trump-russia_probe.html)
 ,Detectives came to our estate to investigate our continued trespassing complaints to uniformed officers.  We described the person as an old white male late at night in the area at the same times and that he was seen dumping nails and weed killer into our road side topiary/s."Yeah we aren't going to help you with that we are more interested in how long you have lived here and if you went to the University of Blank."Here we are long standing property owners in the area showing on video that an old white guy is trespassing to vandalize and they only want to catch us in a lie.Gave them the exact date in the 1980's when the estate was purchased and that no we didn't go there but you like to fit in when everyone else in the area wears that logo so that is why we are wearing their clothing right now it is sold at a discount to push their brand.When you are a mixed race couple (appearance not actually) the race purists really don't like when you point out their (ours) race's crimes the ones they are committing to drive you to panic sell and leave 'their' Township.So we swallowed our pride admitted we are not 20 anymore and we did not go to the liberal supremacist alma mater.Ego is not worth lying to the police over maters that have nothing to do with the property crimes in question in this day and age of entrapment.We learned right there to call the State Police from now on if we need help.
 ,Being the shit storm to the table
 ,So I guess weaponizing the FBI doesn’t always work huh Hilary?
 ,Well of course.  This is the Nixon strategy.   It doesn't matter if there is a "crime".  The point is to create an investigation and the trap the target in a technicality.
 ,Unfortunately in the US this is meaningless.  The courts have watered down entrapment to be meaningless.  For an entrapment defense the accused has to prove that they would not have committed the crime given the opportunity if the cop hadn't of tricked them into it.  It is almost impossible to prove and cops set things up so they can say "if I hadn't of been a cop and the exact same opportunity happened he would have committed the crime."  The only thing it ends up defending against is a cop saying on video "I'm a cop and you better commit this crime or else" after you refuse to commit the crime.
 ,the 5th amendment exists to help prevent entrapment.70 hours interrogating one man and he WILL commit a crime.
 ,Interesting position. The Constitution is pretty vague on what constitutes a "high crime or misdemeanor" but it definitely doesn't say "impeach the president for any or no reason if you have the votes".If the Supremes can weigh in on the meaning of "shall not be infringed" we can at least ask them to clarify what would rise to the level of an impeachable offense under the founders original framework.
 ,Also all 30 Dems who were in office during the Clinton impeachment trial voted "no" on the obstruction of Justice charge. That includes Nancy Nadler mad Maxine etc. So even the dems by precedent don't believe that obstruction rises to the level of an impeachable offense.Also there was no obstruction in this case anyway.
 ,##DO NOT COOPERATE##DO NOT GIVE THEM A SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER##ASK THEM TO JUSTIFY THEIR INVESTIGATION TO THE SUPREME COURT##IOW FUCK YOU!!!!!!🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
 ,Don't wait for "if" Mr. President.  They attempted a coup they spied on you for years under knowingly false pretenses and fake information they obtained from the DNC.Call up a special investigator and give him the mission to put the Democrats behind bars.  If you don't retaliate then the countless crimes of the left will go unpunished.
 ,**I LIKE BEER**
 ,##**MY *FAVORITE* PRESIDENT**
 ,Second part?
 ,He is holding one card that he hasn’t used. He can declassify all the documents if it comes to a full blown war. The people should also organize mass protests in DC for the first ever coup attempt being done in the US history to take down an innocent US president.
 ,well good the sooner the better to clarify this impeachment nonsense.it was retarded when they did it to Clinton and impeachment pursuit has been nothing more than ridiculous partisan political war waging during an existing executive branch term - **THIS HURTS THE COUNTRY AND THE ELECTED EXECUTIVE BRANCH FUNCTIONING**The Supremes should clarify exactly what constitutes (and doesnt) an impeachable offense. It isnt if the POTUS wears a tie you dont like or sends a mean tweet. There have been MANY articles written by scholars on what the phrase "High crimes and midemeanors" means. SCOTUS should clarify for the good of the country. And they also should spell out that it is not the function of the legislative branch to go on 4 year investigative expeditions to try and find any such crimes they can shoehorn into this definition (which is what happens now and has happened with every actual power transfer in the last 50 years - notice I say actual because the Clinton-Bush-Obama terms were all 1 actual party  in reality).
 ,I wonder why He hasnt gone there yet. It can't be constitutional to search for crimes. It can't be constitutional to get taxes for him his entire family and anyone related. It can't be constitutional to have endless investigations with no crime.something has to stop
 ,This is why we put a non-politician in office. Finally a conservative that will fight back!
 ,Dems are trying to get a lot of mileage out of the "I'm fucked" quote from the Mueller report. That quote appears in Volume II of the report (page 78). That quote came from Jody Hunt who was Jeff Sessions' chief of staff. **Evidence for the Quote**: The citation for the quote are Hunt's "contemporaneous notes." The creation of these notes are an effort to get around the rules against hearsay by squeezing into one of the  [exceptions to the hearsay rule](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_803).  We are apparently supposed to believe that people like Hunt were sitting in these meetings *furiously transcribing* what is being said word for word and by hand as though they are stenographers. Either that or they were surreptitiously recording the President of the United States. Or... after the meeting they created notes containing the statements they ***wanted*** to have been said in the meeting. James Comey is now well-known for that tactic. His "contemporaneous notes" are treated as conclusive evidence of what was said at a specific place and time. **Context for the Quote**: The quote was allegedly made during a meeting on May 17 2017. That's the day that Jeff Sessions recused himself and Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as Special Counsel. [The day before](https://clintonfoundationtimeline.com/may-16-2017-opinion-robert-mueller-did-interview-president-trump-regarding-obstruction-case/) (May 16) President Trump actually met with Robert Mueller and Rod Rosenstein in the Oval Office. The Mueller report makes no **direct** mention of this meeting. But... the report does indirectly refer to the meeting on page 65-66 of Volume II. On page 66 : >At noon Sessions Rosenstein and Hunt met with McGahn and White House Counsel 's Office attorney Uttam Dhillon at the White House. ^(421)The **report claims** that this was noon on May 8 2017. But it wasn't. According to footnote 421: >see Gauhar-000056-72 (2/11/19 Memorandum to File attaching Gauhar handwritten notes) ("Ms. Gauhar determined that she likely recorded all these notes during one or more meetings on **Tuesday May 16 2017**.").Unfortunately the report omits the fact that **Robert Mueller was also there**... the day before he'd be appointed as Special Counsel. All the people who were in the room on the 17th had been there as well. This provides us with a pretty important understanding of what was going on in that room and why the President had cause to be upset. He had just been officially thrown under the bus by everyone in that room... the same people who just one day prior told him that they weren't going to do that. They were all telling him one thing (in the Oval Office) while running around the West Wing to get the Special Counsel set up... against him. That's insane.
 ,Keep fighting President Trump!  I am behind you 100%
 ,Trump is doing this so that the SC will define Obama's sedition as high crimes. (Coup attempt)
 ,The Dems are using the impeachment narrative to disempower votes for Trump in 2020. It's about OPTICS not truth or evidence or any such rational logical thought. They are schoolyard bullies who want an audience for their malevolence.
 ,DESPITE
 ,We'll 1776 if they try
 ,1) this is illegal its discrimination   2) Get Woke Go Broke
 ,Here is  the [link.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6952927/Melbourne-cafe-boasted-charging-male-customers-18-cent-man-tax-closing-down.html) From the article “The way the world responded (to the man tax) showed us how fragile masculinity is and solidified the necessity for us to confront and dismantle patriarchy”. This “girl” is perfect example of the left and the way they think. Problem is you’ll get through that thick skull you’ll never reason with someone who thinks like this...
 ,There are plenty of willing soibois in Melbourne in a cunt drought bigger than the Simpson desert willing to virtue signal for a root. The fact is They sold overpriced shit that simply wasn't fit to eat. And none of the other cafe's nearby charged a tax based on gender. Guess everyone chose to eat better for cheaper. Poor service poor food and a poor business model did for it in the end. Capitalism at it's best. But it does give me a few business ideas for the vacant space. Like a bbq and steakhouse that gives a 20% discount on steak and beers for dads with more than 2 kids. That'll get their panties in a twist
 ,The world has gone mad!!!  What's next?
 ,Gee a radical lesbian business didn’t catch on with **normal people?** I’m shocked. (I’m not.)
 ,That's about $5300 in sales.This isn't a brag it's a beg. No wonder they failed.
 ,Hates men tries to look like a man. Liberal logic.
 ,They don't live in reality.
 ,Stupid idea for a restaurant! Why not just bring back segregation too? Stop dividing America!
 ,Sometimes I think these are failing businesses looking for a hail mary. They know the media will be all over anything anti male or pro commie so they get one last hit of customers before closing. Thats just my guess tho.
 ,As M Night Shamalamaramadingdong would say WHAT A TWIST!I personally never saw it coming. Did you?
 ,All the men had to do was identify as women. Nah fuck it. Go bust is better.
 ,Ha place was vegan and The company touted its ethical and ecologically conscious practices  such as “abandoning take-away cups single use straws and napkins by  shopping locally and supporting women owned businesses.”  WTF
 ,Go ahead be a victim for perceived equality so woke.
 ,This is what hapoens when you open a business without the main intent of making money.....  shit its hard enough even if you have that goal in mind.
 ,This new wave of racism and sexism needs to die. It’s now under the guise of being woke
 ,Proof that 1964 civil rights act was bullshit and everyone knows it. It'd never get enforced in favor whites or men and anything it was a bullshit overreach of government
 ,If I went in there I would just identify as a woman and not pay the tax!
 ,“It was not immediately clear why the safe space for lesbians and women is closing but the cafe has faced widespread backlash in the past..”Seriously.. are people really this stupid or are they just avoiding stating the obvious?
 ,Simple just identify as a woman and watch them go nuts.
 ,Can we order a gender neutral "Womp Womp?"
 ,They did this backwards.They should have charged women an 18% surchargeAfter all for centuries men have picked up the tab for women. (though I never understood exactly why)
 ,Give preferential treatment to half of your customers while ripping off the other half...GREEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAT business plan. Bravo. Are you surprised?
 ,So when you shit on people and treat them as second class citizens they wal away?  WOw facinating findings.  Did they assume gender when somebody entered the establishment?  DId they charge blacks the same as white?
 ,Odd the sign says 21% not 18% which is even higher. If that's true she only made $909 off of men before tax. Assuming each meal is $10 that's under 100 men!Not a smart business plan by any means.
 ,So many questions.1. Does she identify as a male?2. If so does she charge herself 18% for any purcahses?3. Does she charge any of her female friends who identify as males or does this only apply to ones who are bilogically males?
 , This week on... when keepin' it real goes wrong...

 ,That 18% difference in pay includes billionaire males. Take those away and it’s about even.
 ,Um... "Forcing" people to pay extra is not what charity is supposed to be...&#x200B;But leftists are retarded so...
 ,lmao get woke go broke. I can just see the freshmen intro to business class. "So professor how about we implement a two tiered price scheme AND change the culture in our store to make half of our customer base feel alienated! No no no but hear me out we will make those changes will be in response to a thoroughly debunked theory and the social justice street cred alone will make our business BOOM!!!  What do ya think?"

 ,Sit and spin feminist fuck!
 ,Isn't this discrimination? The left is regressive.
 ,Wow imagine that treat half your customer base like crap and make them pay more and they don't support your business who would have thought that you would soon go broke.
 ,The law of unintended consequences strikes again.  Do these morons just not have the power to think things through.  Take a step outside your echo chamber every once and awhile will ya.

 ,Twitter is a microcosm of what it would be like if liberals are able to gain power.  Intelligent and centrist liberals have handed over their voices to the progressives in their party who are increasingly radical. Additionally rather than listening to the content of what people say they have deferred the power in their culture to the alter of intersectionality -- the higher on that pyramid the greater your power. Within their own sense of righteous indignation they have created a fascist culture in which opponents are silenced and people who fall inline are valued but people who push the line even further left are promoted.

Gore brought up this case as an example of why there should be federal hate crimes with harsher penalties pointing out that it happened in Bush's own state of Texas.  Bush responded with (paraphrasing) "he was sentenced to death what more would you want?"

 ,I can respect and understand the feelings of some members of James Byrd Jr.'s family wishing him to spend life in prison instead. I don't agree with it.

 ,When higher education is free it will be worth everything that you paid for it.
 ,This is myself my wife and children.  We all worked our way through College.  I could have paid for my children but have a strong belief that earning something is far more valuable in life that being given something free with no strings.  Leftists hate my attitude because they want stuff for free from others while not doing the same.
 ,Well done and you are not alone.We spent well over 200000 on several kids in college no loans we paid it ourselves. We were happy to be able to afford college for our kids sacrificed things for ourselves to get it done but we grew up believing that was America make Life better for your kids.If amnesty is offered to those who are failing to pay their loans then I demand a 'loan' for about 300 large...Papa needs new shoes er boots.
 ,I have 58k in student loan debt. I still dont care- I signed on that dotted line and it's my responsibility. Does it sound appealing to have my debt wiped out? Of course but then I leave fantasy island and rejoin the real world.
 ,When I was in the Army we were at AIT during Christmas and so everyone got leave to go home.I never went off base to go party I never spent a dime of my money all the way through basic training aside to get a cell phone; almost everyone at AIT would get weekend leave and go off base and party- well come Christmas time there’s a girl crying because she doesn’t have enough to buy a plane ticket back home and cried to the NCO’s and they basically went around with a collection plate to get her a ticket home.I was smoked for not giving any money and for  pointing out that she would go off post every weekend and get a hotel and party it up to people who were giving their hard earned money to her. Sorry to vent but this post reminded me of that situation and also fuck her..
 ,Do you think the market is over saturated with College Degrees and that Trade School seems to have more of a Demand?
 ,Sadat made education free in Egypt now every taxi driver and barber has a PhD. Too bad the people who know best how to fix our world are so busy driving and cutting hair...
 ,Education shouldn't be free! College is an investment one that I thought was important for the field I am in and although I have a lot of debt I'm happy with my decision. I have a job where I'll be able to pay back my loans someday and I don't want that forgiven! I knew what I was doing and I stand by that. Nor do I want to pay for the kid who went to college for transgender studies or whatever. It's their decision it's their debt to pay off. End of story!
 ,Yeah i feel ya. I did army ROTC and paid my way with service. There are many paths to go to college and not accumulate hundreds of thousands in debt. Be smart figure it out. I’m not paying for these dumbasses poor financial decisions.
 ,If college debt is wiped out then every American alive who paid for college/student loans should get fully reimbursed for all of it plus interest indexed for inflation. Those are reparations we can get behind.
 ,Got loans out the ass had to get a bio degree to go into medical school. Almost done with med school going to suck paying back the sickening amount I had to take (250000 it's impossible to work in medical school) but these whiney liberal arts majors need to gtfoh go to community college for that shit.
 ,My wife and I made the same sacrifices to pay off our students loans.
 ,That's the thing these people act like everyone should be able to go to private institutions for free and piss away money on the brain-washing.  There's plenty of state schools that you can pay with a small amount of loans and part-time work.
 ,I quit higher education for a vocational job. I wasted 3 years of my gi bill on bullshit but whatever
 ,Congrats.  I also worked through college.  Had under 20k in loans when i graduated.  I work with a LOT of people who borrowed 50k or more.  The explanation is the same almost every time.  They were offering it so why not.
 ,I started saving for college when I got my first allowance.   School paid off been saving like a mad man since.  Put it this way my bank account is well hung today.  Bigger than big Mike's 🍆
 ,I worked 48 hours while taking 12 units every semester. Still had to take out loans. Still in debt. Fuck me I guess.
 ,My wife and me did exactly this. They can pry that money from my cold dead hands.
 ,This is so dumb. Bad colleges and banks need to be punished for price gouging.
 ,I like to gloat about my success's because I earned each and everyone of them. A problem I find is I don't have an outlet to express my views because so many others find negative connotations when successes are spoke of. I don't get it so much.I to went to college too paid off my loans while saving for a home. It all took a decade to accomplish. There was a little whining in-between all that the usual; working is hard..  I'm not getting paid enough.. I bounced a few jobs but in the end problem solved. I too partied like a mfkr and developed some legit functioning alcoholic issues but shaped up and shipped out.I can honestly say If I had thought someone else was going to come in fix everything for me I'd still be working my first job after college at Lowes (Tool World!) spending all that pay on fastfood and beer. lol
 ,If you honor your commitments you are about to be made a fool of.
 ,This will be an important 2020 issue. Here's some thoughts:1. You cannot do loan forgiveness without also doing free (or heavily subsidized) college for all going forward. If you don't make college free-ish that means you're forgiving the loans of this decade's graduates but then still fucking the future. This means it'll cost 2-3x as much as loan forgiveness alone. That's an important part of the cost.2. People who go to college tend to be more upper class than lower class. So this is a giant cash-giveaway to people who are **not poor**. That is a weird and challenging pivot since the previous mantras have all been "tax the millionaires and billionaires to pay for the poor."3. Anyone that paid off debt sacrificed to avoid debt or didn't go to college will be annoyed. Also anyone who will have less forgiven than their expected tax increase over their lifetime *could* be annoyed.4. All of these proposals only cover **public** colleges. About 30% of students go to slightly more expensive private universities. Those kids are disproportionately white. So when public college becomes free they'll all apply to public college. They will displace the lowest applicants who are likely the applicants with the fewest resources. Those will tend to be poor and will tend to be POC. So... are we now going to subsidize college for rich white kids and make POC pay for private university? Or will we subsidize that 30% of private universities as well? What happens when many of those universities are religious?5. Any time they talk about loan forgiveness people say that they'd "buy a car buy a house travel etc." This is basically the same thing rich people do. They're saying they will take on new financial loan instruments and spend money out of country. Food stamps even if you hate them have a pretty good ROI by injecting cash into local economies. An upper middle class guy buying a new entry-level BMW on loan with his savings is really no better than a rich person buying a new high-end BMW on loan with his savings. If they think giving the rich money is dumb so is giving the upper-middle class.
 ,I would have loved to go away for 4 years all expenses paid .. instead I bussed tables went to City College and lived at home.  Taking on debt is a choice.
 ,Unfortunately this argument really doesn't hold up anymore.  Yeah most of us did it but we didn't do it in the last 10-15 years. Once the government started getting involved in student loans tuition prices skyrocketed.  They have increased at a higher rate than any other category for nearly the last 20 years.When I went to college my tuition was 7k a year.  Today at the same college it's over 25k and that's on the low end for most schools. It's hard to tell a 20 year old to work part-time while going to school and surely they can make 25k+ after taxes and living expenses just stop complaining.What we should be discussing is the effect of federal subsidies on the *cost* of college not what to do about the debt incurred. The problem isn't the loans it's the fact that college tuition is twice what it should be because the government is subsidizing it.
 ,at least we’re paying for education and not their food stamps or “disability”

 ,"There have also been conflicting reports about the fate of Hashim with claims circulating that he was one of the suicide bombers who carried out the attack and counter-claims that he may be on the run in the neighbouring Maldives islands.Although known primarily as a luxury honeymoon destination the Maldives also supplied hundreds of radicalised fighters to Isil’s failed attempts to set up an Islamic caliphate in the Middle East....One working theory among regional security experts is that returning fighters could have provided training and logistics to the marginal NTJ which although a cheerleader of global jihad had only been known previously for defacing Buddhist statues in Sri Lanka.**In January police in Puttalam some 100 miles north of Colombo raided a coconut plantation where they discovered 100kg of C4 explosives 100 detonators 75kg of ammonium nitrate and potassium chlorate and six 20 litre cans of nitric acid.**  Reports at the time did not name the group involved but said the site may be linked to a newly emerging militant group that was tied to the vandalising of Buddhist statues. Suspects were arrested but later released on bail.Three months later Sri Lankan security agencies received a tip-off from Indian and US intelligence agencies that the NTJ may be preparing to carry out terrorist acts against churches but the crucial information was not passed to country’s prime minister."

Collusion was paying for Russian research to undermine the POTUS.Obstruction was destroying subpoena'd evidence.Obstruction was preventing the government from functioning at full potential due to nonstop investigations. Treason was selling off our uraniumTreason was letting our ambassador get murderedWhat's the body count for the Clinton's now? Haiti? Whitewater?If you have not realized it yet every single thing the Clinton's accuse POTUS of they have already done. It is simply to take the attention away from them and try to shove it off to someone else.
 ,Crazy that with all the evidence against the Clinton’s they are still untouchable. Goes to show just how tyrannical our government really is.
 ,Come to think of it. Where the heck is BLM?
 ,If by "spirit" you mean "Soros money" ...
 ,Remember all the mass protests planned for Mueller if he got fired? Hahahahahahaha everything just backfires on them
 ,Too confused.None of their tricks worked.People saw through BLM noticed they just wanted to kill white people and the police.  People saw through the "Women's" March that it was just a trick to get American women to dress in hijabs and to declare war on the USA and to establish sharia law.  People saw through Occupy it was just anarchists who wanted to break everything and to use the street as a toilet.The "refugee" support marches everyone figured out that they were waving Mexicon and other flags from the south of the border areas and it was just an invasion.What else was there recently?The "Climate" and "Vegan" marches that are coincidentally all happening at the same time around the world.  Just the UN trying to take money from the west  impose Third World laws over it.All the Oregon stuff protest against ICE and the police.  Sane people know without ICE and the police they don't get to exist.A protest by Britney Spears fans?  They are running out of ideas.Soros and the UN and the infiltrators in the West and the traitors in the West will get those marches going again soon for the 2020 campaign.Those who burn automobiles and break shop windows are what the future is if Bernie Kamala and any of those nutjobs get into power.  That is why the English-speaking voters usually vote for President Trump and those like him.
 ,#WINNING!
 ,they betted all in on the mueller😁
 ,Or Soros funding is tight???
 ,Outrage fatigue. It is hard to stay mad when things are going so well for the country and Trump keeps on winning.
 ,it's because illegals are pouring in by the millions  and they know that all they have to do it is wait it out :(
 ,They are all in London having die-ins purposely trying to get arrested and literally gluing themselves to the street to stop climate change.
 ,The women's marchers? BLM? The Berkley rioters? All gone. The Left's spirit is broken and the money's dried up. Now all they have is bitching and censorship.
 ,What a bunch of fucking morons
 ,They always take time out when it’s cold.  They’ll start showing up in another month or so.  Always happens around fight season.Sadly I don’t think there spirit is drained as much as their souls are
 ,The Money has dried up
 ,Losers all non appreciative spoiled participating trophy LosersUpsets me so much when they say America is never goodThey never visited a 3rd world country before they have no idea how good they have it
 ,I mean we all saw the Craigslist ads... quick pocket money to show up and scream: the mobs with no values screaming for a dollar.
 ,The steady stream of anti-Trump stuff that was my Facebook feed has dried up to basically zero. I even checked the history of some of my most zealous friends and theyve deleted a shit ton of old posts
 ,Can we do like a Daria protest?"Oh what? We have to stand again?"
 ,This is currently on the top of r/all/rising. Like number 1. Goes to show how fucked the algorithms keeping T_D off the front page are.
 ,They were going to march if:  ~~Robert Mueller was fired~~  ~~Pardons of key witnesses~~  ~~Firing Rod Rosenstein~~  ~~Preventing the investigation from being conducted freely~~  ~~If Mueller finds Significant wrongdoing~~  ~~If Mueller's findings are hidden from the public~~
 ,I love how they say *"we need to overthrow the system"* when that was the entire point of Trump being the anti-establishment outsider undoing the last 8 years of failure.
 ,The Jews had second thoughts after half of the left kicked them out of the last women's march for not defending Palestine.
 ,**They ran out of money for it its going to campaigns instead and optics would look bad.**   **Remember 2018.  No if we win back the country it is going to take ALOT of work.  This is 30 years of corruption to undo.**
 ,the usual threads on 4chan have slowed to a trickle that it self says a lot. But r/ politics still in full TDS meltdown modethe other day every topic on the 1st page was about trump Muller or Burr basically every single topic was about trump...
 ,Maybe with the roaring economy they all found work.
 ,They'll be back and as petulant as ever for the 2020 campaign. Enjoy the breath of fresh air for now they will be screaming at the sky and we sick of their shenanigans and their double treatment by the media/politicians/law enforcement soon enough.They may even do another unite the right honeypot rally paid for by a leftist to start more trouble.
 ,Nah Soros hasnt found a cause good enough to pay them to protest.
 ,This is definitely the time to be the ones reaching out and letting em know that we're on their side whether they realize it or not. The world's not gonna end and the policies we're voting for are designed to help everyone not just repubs. Meme war is fun at the same time we've got to be accessible just enough so that we don't blow em out of the water when their mind opens a bit. Right now they're down and if we help em up it'll pay off.
 ,They are waiting for instructions and warmer weather.BLM is not an "organic grassroots movement." Like many Leftist shock-troop groups their "community organizers" await Soros funding and the "go" signal. When the Leftist Agenda shot-callers deem it necessary to manufacture a distraction/disruption the message is sent to a relatively small number of the aforementioned "organizers" to launch the latest Propaganda Narrative to the hivemind of Their Base who are merely waiting for any excuse to commit the rioting/looting/arson/attacks on innocents that they are going to commit anyway (but in some cases wait for the convenient cover of a riot/police stand-down.)
 ,Embarrassing to see it in my home =(
 ,Assets seized from their funders.
 ,Not spirit it's all about the money Hopefully Trump is shutting down many behind the scenes
 ,Protests are too much work with little reward for them. They are in the process of evolving into full blown terrorism.
 ,Maybe with the roaring economy they all found jobs.
 ,Maybe with the roaring economy they all found jobs.
 ,More like their pockets have been drained...
 ,and their funds
 ,Huge amount of the Soros money and schemes are moving to EU and mostly Eastern Europe since western is already cucked.
 ,They're having trouble finding paid actors
 ,Well that's because the overlords haven't told the masses about a cross country demonstration yet.
 ,Of course these faggots are in philly....
 ,Weather's getting warmer. They'll be rolling out within the next couple weeks.
 ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4OhbzSFpnk
 ,They've lost a lot of funding.  Sure they still have money to finance illegal alien caravans and political races but none for pointless demonstrations and riots.
 ,Just burning down churches and blowing stuff up...
 ,No they just ran low on funds...to pay the protesters
 ,With so many Democrats running for president any big demonstration would put off some segments of potential voters. Wait about a year after Super Tuesday.
 ,Paying protestors and chartering buses gets expensive and the ROI is clearly not there.
 ,Or....their funds.
 ,They must be tied of losing. I don't think we're tired of winning!
 ,That's Philly. There are still occasional protests but none this large. I'm guessing this was during the DNC. The last one I saw was on the corner of Broad and Locust last year. It was a bunch of people screaming about Palestine.
 ,Their handlers have told them to back it down a notch same thing they did to AOC.
 ,It’s hard to collect Pokémon when you’re always protesting.
 ,Their broke. LOL. Anyone that thinks left wing anything is grassroots is crazy. It is all paid organizations. Plus Union members love Trump.
 ,Fat. Jobless. Marching down safe well built streets. Surrounded by architectural marvels that just 100 years ago would be impossible and many countries still can not make. Yeah. How terrible.
 ,I was waiting for after the Mueller report for them to drum up protests on my local subreddit. But I ain't seen shit.
 ,Nothing left to bitch about.  Orange Man Bad.
 ,They all have better paying jobs now
 ,The big leftist donors are tired of seeing low return on investment in funding the Democrat activist groups.
 ,More like Soros assets were frozen and there is no one to pay them. They were paid protesters. Or he’s spending his money to finance the caravans...
 ,Funny I was just thinking this today as well.
 ,If America "was never great" why the fuck you be here though?
 ,Actually googled the Revcom website on that protest sign turns out it’s the home page of the US Communist Party. Color me fucking shocked that they march side-by-side with Berniebros.
 ,trump cutoff the saudi deep state $$ funnel with MBS and the saudi purge of nov 2017.  Alwaleed or another of the Saud family owns/owned the top 5 floors of the vegas hotel which the oct 1 shooting occured at (i forget but think it was mandalay bay).  its very possible that shooting was cover for soome kind of proxy battle for succession being fought between crown prince MBS and his other relatives such as 1-800-DeepStateFundingGuy Dopey Prince Alwaleed.
 ,Soros money frozen.
 ,Supreme court rules public sector employees not required to pay union dues and suddenly a shitload less BLM Antifa and Communist agitators in the streets. Coincidence?
 ,They probably are being told by their handlers that too much publicity will not help leftist politicians chances in 2020.
 ,They're reloading the coffers for 2020. Unrest is coming.
 ,It has nothing to do with spirit. They demonstrate when they are told to demonstrate. They stopped because poll numbers told the deep state leadership that it wasn't working and was pissing people off. They need to let the normalcy of it wear off so they can start demonstrating again during the 2020 election. It's a tactic not unlike all of the Dems calling Christians "Easter Worshipers".
 ,America was never great? Go fuck yourself.
 ,Haven't been seeing much of these protesters at all. COuld be that things are not working with the protesting as we all know.
 ,no one likes to protest in the winter?
 ,Nah Soros is plowing money to the crazy Democrat candidates they cost more than a few thousand Pussies-fa....
 ,Their last paid "big" protest was right after the mueller report was set to be released and moveon paid people to want the unredacted report. However not many people showed up to them. They'l have weekly protests after the democrat candidate is selected.
 ,They’re plotting. Not much to do at the moment other than plot.
 ,Demonstrators = Do-Nothing Complainers
 ,They demonstrate their mental retardation on a daily basis so there's that.
 ,It is kinda hard when the president is leading a competent DOJ that will prosecute.  Obama gave the protesters a green light to burn neighborhoods to the ground.
 ,More like they’re out of Soros bucks and have no jobs of their own to pay for their activities.
 ,It’s because of all the infighting they don’t know who should lead the protest or what they’re about so they just don’t do it
 ,Their collusion message has been diluted. It will take time to rally around obstruction if at all.
 ,Just a pause while they make new signs.
 ,No more money
 ,Isn't protesting and "taking to the streets" suppose to be their big thing?  Where are they?
 ,Or maybe they're growing up.
 ,That type never goes away it just waits for the right climate
 ,Protest fatigue
 ,Just wait election year is coming.
 ,Soros is regrouping
 ,$oros concentrating on pushing lllegal migration.
 ,"*N-No!!! We...we've only just started our resistance! D...Drumpf will be in jail any minute now!!! The very first investigation into him is done but we have armies of people who will be looking into his background for decades!!! And if nothing turns up we will DOUBLE OUR EFFORTS!!! HE...HE CAN'T HIDE F..FOREVER!!!"*
 ,That's what happens when nobody pays them to *faux*test.
 ,Funding gone.Watch the money laundered through the matter in Paris.
 ,They're waiting for the next ultra bullshit drama to protest. The Soros' of the world will start funding something soon. My guess is a new SCOTUS seat opens...
 ,Remember the "not my president" rallies were literally funded by Russia. Perhaps the funding dried up?
 ,It's called Rope-a-Dope: Trump is Ali and liberals are George Foreman.
 ,No it’s because it’s bad optics.
 ,They are to busy working. Everyone has a job now. 👍🇺🇸
 ,They’re in the lovely liberal sanctuary city of Philthadelphia there. They should be protesting Mayor Kenney but they only get upset when he taxes soda.
 ,Don't worry. Another bombing or school shooting will galvanize them soon enough. The DS has plans A to Z
 ,Summer is not here yet.
 ,They have to ride out the dem primaries.  Social upheaval can only serve to disturb whatever master plan has been concocted.  Once the chosen one wins the primary they start their strategic REEEEEEEing.Right now the REEEEEEs could backfire so nobody is financing the organizers.
 ,I am betting the next "grassroots" protest will be funded by the Democracy Alliance: https://www.influencewatch.org/organization/democracy-alliance-da/
 ,"America was never great"?Why the fuck are these ppl in the US?And even if it were true America should still be made great
 ,They're forming a new master narrative. Because what they come up with next they'll have to keep through election. Do they continue with Mueller angle...Or do they go for the "caging children" "trans hating" angle.Can't switch half way through from now till then...
 ,An important factor is that while the Democrats certainly band together and vote as such much of the party is split.  It's new school vs old school.  Hannity was right to call AOC the Speaker of the House.  Nancy Pelosi has lost a lot of her influence and while I hear the excuse of her being a money maker as to why the party wants to keep her globalists will fund anything they see fit with or without Nancy.  I warned leftists not to celebrate the mid terms too hard if they went with Nancy as Speaker and that we all know deep down the new crop of progressives are tired of her.  Now we've got AOC and others calling for impeachment in direct opposition to Nancy.  We couldn't ask for a better outcome other than keeping the House the Dems have literally done nothing besides bicker about how evil Trump is.  It's not a good look for them and as OP's title suggests they may indeed be running out of steam.  We can't underestimate them but one has to look at the many losses and wonder if they aren't beat down.
 ,Stupid Libatards lol.
 ,What city is that?
 ,Deport all of them. Fucking terrorists.
 ,Funding is winding down.  Donations have dried up.  HAHAHAHAH.
 ,Soros last hooker was kinda expenisve damn
 ,Have noticed.
 ,Good point. Trump has beaten them into submission. Now they fight on Twitter while drinking their Starbucks
 , All the Soros money is being used south of the border and for use in 2020 elections.
 ,The money from Soros has dried up
 ,“America was never great.”They why the fuck do you still live here ?
 ,They haven't been told to. Maybe Soros is on vacation.
 ,the boy shouts wolf. there is no wolf. people feel used.  again. again. now people learn to ignore.  not just this boy but anyone else shouting 'wolf'.  no one responds to 'wolf' anymore.  or 'lion' or 'tiger' or 'snake' or anything. everyone who shouts is a loser.  people understand that now.the left over protested and got everyone fatigued and confused.  now no one cares.
 ,That's a shame cause every time they do something more people walk away.
 ,Money dried up.
 ,Give it time.
 ,DEMORALIZED!
 ,They are resting up for the Bombathon.
 ,Philly pede here. This Saturday breadlines Bernie is in town. Luckily lll be out of town!
 ,That "America was never great" sign...oof that is so fucked up.
 ,It's sad how the best way to get liberals to vote for you is by talking shit about America and promising to ruin it more.
 ,*Pockets have been drained..
 ,#Follow the $...
 ,No money to pay for a demonstation in the usa because of all the payments to blow up churches wworldwwide
 ,October 2020. Mark it.
 ,No more 0bama slush funds
 ,All the money that Obama released before leaving office has dried up and Soros money is apparently not infinite
 ,The small group of crazies.. they’re losing!
 ,They suffer from Low Energy
 ,Or their cash flow
 ,I was thinking last week this very thing. No antifa no mean pussies no Indian chiefs drumming no BLM nothing. Did the money run out? Did they not achieve anything? Well of course they didn’t achieve anything but did they feel like it was a waste? I saw some dirty lesbians protest school choice today.
 ,Pussy hats cost money
 ,Shot their wad on the fake Russian thing.  The whole Covington Catholic Jussie Smollette things probably made things worse. If they'd have kept their powder dry who knows.  Barring some crisis I think unlikely to see a real challenge.
 ,The last one was a total flop.  They were supposed to "shut the country down" as many claimed.  The local news covered the protests it was literally like 5 people standing on the corner of a dimly lit street shouting at the wind.
 ,They will all be back summer of 2020.
 ,The dude in the bernie shirt lol. You mad brah?
 ,Left handed here...ohhhh
 ,None of that FAKE outrage shit works any more.   We connect the dots too fast.
 ,They ran out of money rations to survive on the streets
 ,Maybe they realized that fighting for quota’s that wouldn’t last in the real world was a lost cause after all...relinquishing the rights of others because someones feelings got hurt should of been blacklisted a long time ago...pass the red pills people
 ,Speaking of leftie weirdos[And they call us a Cult](https://youtu.be/UzkkTWK7K9w)Kindly fuck yourselves.
 ,all these protests get funded
 ,This is the benefit of historically low unemployment. The commies aren’t being paid entitlements to protest.
 ,Donations are down hard since Mueller. They have to save money for Ginsburg’s death orgy.
 ,Summer's coming. I predict sometime between June and July a police shooting of a black criminal will be publicized and the usual rioting looting and arson will ensue.
 ,Maybe Soros finally kicked the bucket.
 ,Wait 18 more months. It’ll start back up after President Trump is re-elected.
 ,Soros calls all the shots
 ,Now’s the time to bring them to church
 ,Their soy and fake news reserves are running low they are suffering great attrition
 ,America was NEVER great?? Why the hell are you here?Grass is ALWAYS greener buddy.
 ,Can’t protest 24/7 you run outta energy. They won’t be out there Election Day.
 ,Im still shocked for some reasons that democrats literally hate America - that banner saying "it was never great"... Then what the fuck are you doing here if it was never great?
 ,Been too cold. It will gear up again now that we are moving into summer.
 ,Money too
 ,Hey it's hard to get up before 2pm
 ,Some people who would join got a job and money isn't flowing in to organize one. You know it costs quite a bit of money to bus in from multiple cities.
 ,Think of Toronto's Jordan Hunt as unhinged a moonbat as you will ever find.  He kicked a defenseless woman while claiming he is for tolerance and inclusion.That and the dozens of incidents like it riled the middle.  The middle is what will keep the Sorosian in the money.
 ,I thought we elected Trump to overthrow the system?
 ,they get practically everything they want why should they bother?
 ,Motives: \[Whatever the TV tell them their enemy is no question\]
 ,Demoralized
 ,More like they have been called off while the commie figure out their next moveAll they had to hang their pussy hats on was impeachment
 ,They complain. Unfortunately low unemployment and the general upward projections of the USA means even the far left have far too much to do to waste there time protesting the president.
 ,Sprinkling a mass of petulant protesters with job applications will over time slowly willow away at the worthlessness of the crowd and once a person has worth they quit the pathetic protest parade.So yeah. President Trump is seemingly forcing some of the people formerly mired in great unwashed loser movement to become great taxpaying Americans again.
 ,Trump stopped their funding.
 ,if their spirit is drained maybe they should try having a cookout to raise it. nothings better for the spirit than cooking.
 ,When your only punch doesn’t work no more. Why throw it.
 ,And the money's dried up.
 ,They're saving their energy for when we beat them again in 2020
 ,They got jobshttps://youtu.be/8ytOXXqHVQk

 ,It's because the Trump economy is SO good and unemployment is SO low these people finally got jobs. Not mobs.
 ,Turns out they can only use their turbo once per episode.
 ,NRA is holding their annual meeting Friday - Sunday.  Trump is set to speak on Friday.  Think the big protest could be set for there?
 ,Screaming "Impeach" at the top of their lungs for two solid years takes a lot out of them.
 ,Probably just too stoned after the Mueller flop
 ,Hype is gone. Al lefties are is just Millenials and Boomers joining the hype to look like they care for something greater than their own life. But when the hype has faded they went back to not caring like they have always really been.;
 ,Isn't it funny how These dems always hold long standing protests but never any republican rioting?&#x200B;All of us are too busy at our full time jobs to riot in streets
 ,Good. They've drained enough out of this country it's time for them to feel what that's like.
 ,And their taxpayer funded slush funds as well.
 ,$$$$$ has dried uppppppppp
 ,Sore Ass was displeased with the ROI and cut funds
 ,I also haven't been online viciously attacked by leftist degenerates in a while( you know the charming NPCs who threaten to kill you tell you to drink bleach threaten to rape your children ect ) ....funds must be shut off there too ...
 ,The economy is booming maybe they went back to work lol
 ,Soros is now spending all his money on dem candiadates and idiot prosecutors.Mobs only made them look worse so i guess the funding dried up.
 ,Two reason. Demonstrations aren't being funded as much  and it's kind of hard acting like the world is going to end when things are objectively better than before. Talk is cheap so that's why they still virtue signal but demonstrations require effort.
 ,We should be somewhat compassionate. These people have consumed and trusted the MSM propaganda for a very long time and are waking up to the lies. It’s a hard place to be mentally. I hope many turn back to God.
 ,It’s because liberals cannot organically meet up to this scale without someone paying for it *cough* Soros!
 ,Or their wallets
 ,Did they all find real jobs?

He chaired the Trump campaign for 3-4 months in between Corey Lewandowski and KellyAnn Conway.But they want him tied to the President even though his crimes have nothing to do with the President. Our media needs to be assfucked with a hot soldering iron. They’ve become a complete disgrace.
 ,*and committed while he was working for hillarys campaign manager and his brother
 ,Psst you yea you OP r/politics is a shithole circlejerk for beta cucks. Nobody cares about their shit opinions.
 ,They’re falling over themselves trying to defend crazy bernie wanting to let terrorists vote. The mental gymnastics is incredible.
 ,Next time a Democrat wins we should launch an "extreme Anal Probing investigation" and send their own "chairs" into Prison for completely unrelated crimes...They wanna put fear into the right in running for Presidency? We should fight back. In fact we need to be fighting back constantly not trying to act "presidential" and politically correct... Everytime we try to save "image" we lose the election. Fight back! They want war? They got it!

 ,taxes....
 ,They're gunna need some tax money to combat these rising gas prices
 ,"California currently imposes the second-highest gas taxes in the country. A state excise tax currently adds $.417 per gallon a rate that will increase to $.473 come July. On top of that the state imposes a **2.25 percent** gasoline sales tax."On top of that extremely high land costs special fees on gas stations environmental fees among other reasons!$2.53 in North Carolina and we have fairly high gas tax.
 ,Hmmm I wonder what could possibly cause a highly taxed overregulated state to have astronomic gas prices? Let's do an expensive investigation to find out!
 ,Because of your fucking taxes "green" fees and initiatives and your want to put anything related to fossil fuels out of business?
 ,Paid $3.85 for the cheapest choice at Costco today 😭😭😭
 ,Uh. That's exactly why. Too much government. But just to make sure we need to form a committee. And we need a committee to form that committee.
 ,It was already higher than everyone else in the nation before they added that 12.5¢ per gallon tax. Our state is run by liberal morons.

 ,For decades the political class in the UK has despised and hated American Republicans.  Half the population of the UK thinks the biggest threat to world peace is the U.S.  Tell me what other nation thinks they have a right to protest our president every time he visits?  The UK has been doing that since Ronald Reagan.   The UK lied about the "sexed up" WMD dossier.  They lied about Basra Iraq too.
 ,The Brits wanted trade deals favorable to them to remain while Trump was a threat to make the deals more fair. Same with Italy and Australia. But now we know these countries helped in the coup.   Uh oh.

 ,Wow they actually applied liberal logic as an argument against a liberal agenda !!They still share common goals...Such as in the highlighted passages from the post...“Buying stuff = bad”“Building new homes = bad”“Having kids = bad”They can hide behind their “muh environment” argument but it’s all the same agenda.
 ,And there is it folks the truth. The left has perpetuated student loan debt to curb prosperity and prevent Americans from having children. Financial enslavement of the masses serves their political agenda. Wow.
 ,When are all these leftist cultists gonna drink the poison and go onto the mothership and be reunited with Gaia?
 ,I already forgave myself and my kids for working/saving going to cheaper state schools and not taking out loans.Where's my free stuff? My carbon footprint is going up someone's ass if I don't get the free stuff dime store injun Warren is promising everyone.

 ,Ahh the schizophrenic left at it again.
 ,These people graduated college?
 ,Their professors would be very proud. Killing yourself to help the earth is not that far off.
 ,People of the US must refrain from making children because of climate change. 🤔But it's totally okay of people of middle east to have five to eight kids per wife coz it's actually good for climate change. 😡As a result there's a lot of land available in US because of low population and/then/so they can migrate here. 🙄Then Trump happens... stands against UN migration pact... 😎Orange man bad!!! 🤣😂 decades of planning ruined I can feel why dems are mad at him...
 ,You can flip anything on them with the way they will accept any slippery slope leading to one of their great fears. When I was a lefty someone asked me if flag burning should be legal and I said "I dunno what about the carbon emissions?"
 ,No one mentions in home global cooling when electricity bills can't get paid.Talking about that wins elections a proven strategy. Continuing to do something about that wins re-elections.
 ,>I pay $600 / moLots of us pay magnitudes more than that and still somehow get by.I pay almost 5x that and when its paid off it will be so magnificent.
 ,Forgiving student loans especially ones that should have no business ever having been lent money to encourages bad investments without consequences.  There needs to be consequences because nobody should have ever been lent money for trangender underwater basket weaving and been suprised when there was no market to have any return on that investment.Instead of burning that money it should have been put to greater societal use.
 ,I’ve heard several leftists argue that a booming economy is bad beacuse of the environment. One told me to my face that bringing back manufacturing to America and increaseing goods made here would contribute to global warming. Which makes no sense. The stuff I buy has to be made somewhere... my Laptop made in China or US would still contribute the same either way to whatever global warming fiction they make up.
 ,Some people very much enjoy signaling to the world the fact they're retarded.

 ,Guess "Rick" who reviewed the restaurant as great and "serving up social justice" didn't come back as promised or more likely never visited the cafe at all. This is what happens when you sacrifice your business to get social media praise.

 ,There is no legit reason for us not to know who is in our country. Not one.
 ,>"millions of Hispanics and immigrants could go uncounted"Only if they don't answer.  Not the census' fault if they refuse.
 ,AP writer upset that non-citizens won't be counted as citizens.
 ,Roberts needs to hurry up and retire. The only thing we can count on him for is to fuck the vote up when we need him most.
 ,This shouldn't even be an issue asking people if they are a legal citizen shouldn't even be a debate.  Illegal aliens don't have the rights of legal citizens.
 ,Some things are so obviously constitutional that to deny it would reveal the level of activism of progressive justices.
 ,**illegal** immigrants duplicitous bastards.
 ,> Despite evidence that millions of Hispanics could go uncounted...That's the point. Our representatives are supposed to represent the people of this nation not third-world invaders that have no business being here.
 ,No. They shouldn't even be hearing this. They're looking for a way to cheat the American people and it's starting to look like they can't.
 ,I don't trust him!  This is too important for them.  Where the heck is RGB?
 ,Great.  2 months for them to figure out how to flip a single vote.  Money?  Intimidation?  Blackmail?

 ,Thanks for the heavy lifting Tom and Team @ JWWith this information you gather and get released under the FOIA process.  Do you have a channel for providing this information to the DOJ Trump admin and/or AG?

 ,On second thought  you need to keep your mouth shut
 ,I am of the belief that after someone has served their time they should be able to vote. However the reason we put them into jail is because they are a danger to society and they need to be "rehabilitated." It makes ZERO sense to suggest they are of sound mind to vote.
 ,Kamala virtue signalled too hard. Oopsie!
 ,"On second thought I shouldn't have initiated those launch codes..."Real world leader material there. She's a born waitress not a politician.

Give them the right to vote! *In an alternate reality where Trump is sent to prison* Leftist: WTF I love Trump now give him the right to vote! In fact prisoners should be allowed to be president while in prison!
 ,Doesn't make sense for these people to vote since they won't be affected since they are in prison during the president's term. Seems that they want people with poor judgement to vote.
 ,##Then why put them in prison? ##Isn’t being free a fundamental right?
 ,What did that dumbass Bernie say? They are paying back their debt to society? Some of these people couldn't pay their debt back with a thousand lifetimes. I'll be ok with the one that cures cancer voting.
 ,plot twist they take the money and vote republican
 ,With the amount of people in prison that's a decent sized voting base. How lightly will politicians have to tread when telling for the whole country to hear how they planning on winning the paedophiles' and murderer's votes.
 ,I also agree that we should deny John Brennan the right to vote.

 ,zomg he didn't say No ObstructionINPEECh
 ,Huh weird how r/politics doesn’t like talking about stocks anymore. That was all they talked about four months ago...
 ,Leftists hate America and its decent citizens. They are a sorry evil perverted bunch. No introspection humility sense of humor or any common sense among them. Too bad they are missing out on the good things in life... I can't imagine.
 ,Hillary and the dems colluded with Russia. Whenever a corrupt dem says Donald Trump did xyz take it as projection.
 ,There is no point in using reason with Democrats. They need to be hit with indictments from hillary on down. The only discussion with them is through their lawyers in court.
 ,Self reflection and working for the good of all US citizens isn't what career politicians are capable of.
 ,Thank you Mr. President. This economy would have never been great if the Witch had won. My 401k thanks you!!!
 ,#Mr. President they are not going to stop attacking you until we begin prosecuting the criminals.
 ,Orange man bad Peach 🍑 fowty fi!!!!!!
 ,Every tweet from here on out should end with "no Collusion" even if it has nothing to do with what he's talking about. Keep reminding the left what they kept pretending was real for over 2 years
 ,Trump could end world hunger and the media would complain that he had 2 scoops of ice cream.
 ,Doesnt trump know this is still obamas economy?
 ,At this point I dont want  those libtard pigs giving this great man/great President any credit for anything may they all rot in hell. TRUMP2020. They should keep his name out of their mouths.
 ,He left out no obstruction!! We've got him now~dems probably
 ,>3 year change: 49.98%+Kek world record
 ,No you won’t. So please start jailing them all!
 ,Of course they'll never give you credit Mr. President.With a strong economy nobody needs Democrats & government benefits to survive. That's why they want you gone before 2020 because they know they'll lose against you.
 ,GEOTUS is like that "Serial Shitter" that plagued Colorado a couple years ago.  Everyday he cracks open his Twitter and just unloads on the Fake News and ShitLibs.They tither-on about running around screaming about some ridiculous bullshit while everyone else just fucking laghs at them.

 ,They can try to impeach Trump. The keyword is *try* because they know what will come next.
 ,We give all the credit to our favorite President for creating an environment that rewards investment instead of punishing it.  The Communists can’t stand all this prosperity and wealth building for anyone but themselves.🇺🇸🦅
 ,I actually feel really bad for this man. Everything he's done and he can't catch a single solitary break. Meanwhile all Obama had to do was fart into the wind and the media would sing endless chorus' to his name. It honestly does make me sick.
 ,Obama is as responsible for the good economy as Bush is responsible for ending the recession.
 ,We love you Mr. President.  we have complete faith in you and appreciate everything you do for our nation.  your sacrifice is truly incalculable.  You are a true Hero of America.  and will go down in history as the single most effective and productive president in history.  Bar none.The fact that you make leftist's heads exploding every day is a really nice bonus.
 ,the krassensteins are actual idiots LMAO
 ,I started my own business in 2018 and work A MINIMUM of 6 days a week because people will NOT STOP CALLING! This economy is insane. I'm so fucking tired of working but am very happy that I've been this successful.Bless this man and this great economy.

 ,*President Obama hit presumptive GOP presidential nominee* [*Donald Trump*](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) *for not detailing the ways in which he plans to accomplish certain goals.**During a PBS town hall that aired Wednesday Obama referenced Trump's promise to bring back jobs to the United States when talking about manufacturing.**“Well how exactly are you going to do that? What exactly are you going to do? There’s no answer to it" Obama said.**"He just says 'Well I’m going to negotiate a better deal.' Well what how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is he doesn’t have an answer.”*Abra.&#x200B;Fucking.&#x200B;Cadabra.
 ,President Trump should not tie his success to the stock market it’s fickle regularly has value corrections and doesn’t necessarily reflect the actual economy because it often reflects expectations instead.  But this economy is soaring and will continue to soar higher with more jobs more earnings and lower unemployment even if the stock market lowers and makes a correction. The stock market is absolutely responding to President Trump’s taxation improvements his leadership and the tangible improvements in production and the overall economy.   But taking credit for it going up leaves you open to criticism when it goes down and there could be numerous reasons for a downturn completely independent of President Trump but the main stream media will be blind to that truth in their reporting. One other thing about our great President while I’m at it. If the media are reporting that his approval rating is at 53% then the real number is probably closer to 60%.  What does this tell us about Democrats who have walked away from the Democratic Party?  It tells us a landslide is coming in 2020.
 ,They are Irrelevant.
 ,We should be so lucky as to have the Dems try to impeach him. I want them talking nothing BUT impeachment all the way up to the 2020 election. The more they talk impeachment the more they show everyone in the country who *isn't* already brainwashed on leftist Kool-Aid (who are to be honest mostly too far gone to be saved and are going to vote Dem regardless) that the Democrats have absolutely no platform other than "resist Drumpf no matter the cost to everyday Americans." Moderates who probably would've voted Democrat as a matter of course might be pushed towards voting third party not at all or possibly even Republican while non-stop impeachment talk will only galvanize the right into voting Democrats out of Congress.Every moment the Democrats are acting insane is a moment that benefits us and all their rumbling about impeachment will go nowhere because any impeachment vote will never pass the Senate. Dems needed to take both the House and Senate with their 2018 "blue wave" in order to make their impeachment fantasy a reality and they failed to do it. All they can do now is bark.
 ,My emerging national businesses ETF are thanking him.
 ,I love Trump tweets just to hear the Lamentations of the Krassencucks.

 ,They're always talking Mr. President while you keep doing. Thank you!
 ,It is about keeping Obama out of court is it not?The left feels Obama will lead the nation to communismand they are totally committed.
 ,He’s right! (Naturally) If I we’re him at this point I’d walk up to my stalkers  “journalists”  Stick up BOTH of my middle fingers and say Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkk you. BC Fuck them.
 , You get plenty of Kudos here Mr. President. Everyday i wake up with a smile
 ,Yeah but then again those retards have been harping about impeachment for the last two years. The Dem/Left/SJWs are just extremely sore losers and all this is is their new feeble attempt to win an argument. Ain't gonna happen.

Them: BZZZt\*crackle \*POP\*\* Internal screeching you're so dum you nazi Me: OK.. so I'm a nazi whooptie doo you still haven't answered the question you know there is nothing to impeach him for and he hasn't lied about anything you also know you need a 2/3rd majority in congress to impeach a sitting president right?  Them: OMG UR DUM You muist be a racist too !  Me: yeah? so what? - Answer the question...  Them: ARG THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WIN !!!! HAHAHA IMPEACH NAOW!!!  Me: Boy you're really not going to get over his win in 2020 are you......  Welcome to every single day of my life.....
 ,Fools actually believe to themselves that the roaring economy is due to Obummer. This is the uninformed electorate that we must defeat in November of next year!!!
 ,Literally just the yapping about of angry liberals wanting to usher in United menstrual cycles of America. The president is for the people of the union not private assimilated cunts with foreign constituents.
 , It's time for an independent group like Tom Fittons to start the dirt digging of house Democrats. He would need an excavator with that much dirt.
 ,Thank you President Trump for everything you have done for all Americans!You are a true hero and patriot!  On a personal note our small business has grown so fast in the past two years that my husband and I are almost exhausted keeping up with it and that's a good thing! Keep up the great work Sir!
 ,I wish he’d stop saying they can’t impeach because of the Economy. They can’t impeach because he did nothing wrong! Those dumb motherfuckers
 ,The more your 401k goes up the more taxes you'll pay at retirement! /s

 ,No shit my investments are the highest of all time Tonight right now.  He's done really well for long term investors (I.e. people with retirement accounts)
 ,Can someone explain to me what they think they can impeach him for?
 ,Impeachment for WHAT??!!! Not liking a a GREAT POTUS!!
 ,No you will never be given credit by the crazy Dems but I sure wouldn’t worry about it. The people know what you have done for us and the country and we love you for it....Thank you Mr. President...
 ,The stock market is part of the reason the leftists are talking impeachment.  They have to divert attention from the great job GEOTUS is doing.
 ,No collusion! Knew it was bullshit since day one.
 ,I'm a supporter but this is not a good move. The stock market is not a good indicator of how well the economy is doing and every time a politician uses it as one it always seems to bite them in the ass.
 ,I love Trump and all but I don't think a president can be responsible much for the stock market. It's all based on speculation and fear
 ,I would love to be an investor right about now!
 ,From Europe with love. Keep doing what you do son the daily dramas on my social media timelines are pricesless
 ,Every week I feel like I'm getting rich off the stock market and I give Trump credit. Thanks for making me fucking rich Trump!
 ,I have friends who sold all their stocks after the 2016 election predicting doom in the markets. I had faith in Trump and held onto all my stocks (over $150k). Everything's gone up by 40-50% since the election. Thank you Trump!
 ,Mmm...Tendies
 ,I mean the reality is that none of the presidents really have a whole lot to do with the stock market. We don't live in state run economies.I realize policies and regulations can obviously influence business but it's nowhere near what any politician claims it is. Like how Obama was some savior for the rebound after 08 even though boom and bust is how the markets have worked for pretty much ever.
 ,Glad he's speaking out about it openly. Being humble at a time like this would be suicide.
 ,How come no one talking about how fucked the kids are with social security
 ,The market always looks forward and it is indicating there is no faith in the Left's path.
 ,Because he can't be controlled they must impeach...pathetic!
 ,Rush says they will impeach (just the House not enough votes in Senate) and run on it in 2020:  Trump is an *impeached* President!  He is illegal!  Vote him out!
 ,Like everything else they’ve redefined what ‘success’ is. Trump impeeched = perfect world ala Pepsi commerical.

 ,I have an attorney friend who is one of the main guys going after the BS for allowing pedos to molest kids.  He's seen a lot of these files.  The stuff he tells me is sickening.  The BS knew what was happening and chose to cover it up instead of outing the pedos.

 ,What really shocked me beyond the obvious was how sleazy Sander's non-answer to the question was. He danced around it like crazy. I don't understand what the 'anti-establishment' progressives see in him. He talks exactly like every other politicians and gives bizarre and convoluted responses to straightforward questions. He's not even articulate. Ron Paul no matter how crazy some of his ideas may have sounded could at least tell you what economic or political theory he was basing them on. Sanders probably only skimmed though the CliffNotes study guide to Das Kapital.

 ,> What changed?The rising extremism of both major parties. They're shifting rather radically away from each other. [This gif shows how this has happened over the past 50 years.](https://gfycat.com/wellmadeshadowybergerpicard).> What do you think the problem is?I think this is a natural consequence of liberal Democracy. The idea is that Democracy protects against extremism since the majority of people are probably Centrists. However we're in the middle of a paradigm shift that is causing reactionary responses from both sides and thus breeding extremist ideas. The internet is a big contributing factor since it allows almost instantaneous communication from almost everywhere. So these groups are able to become better organized and have a louder voice with the internet.> How do we fix it?I have no idea honestly. I think the country will continue to divide the way it has. There's been talk about just going our separate ways since the country is just about divided in half over very different visions of society. And I think this is the case: the two parties just have very different visions of what they think our country should be.
 ,Depends.If people treat any sort of political conversation as "I am debating the entire leftist/conservative worldview" it will be unproductive.If you go into any sort of political discussion thinking that the best outcomes are to "win" by stumping the other party with some talking point or one-liner or if you think you are going to be able to dismantle their entire worldview in one conversation then it is not an actual debate/conversation.Listen to the other side.  What are they concerned about?  Will their proposed solution actually help?  Are solutions offered by your side better?
 ,debate all you want.  There will be no agreement.  Esentially we want different and sometimes opposite things. A secession/divorce will happen  eventually
 ,No it is over. Leftism has won.
 ,if you were honest and rational you wouldn’t be a capitalist or nationalist and therefore would not be conservative
 ,Links really don't establish anything if both parties were looking for something different.  Every president is helped into power by different groups; look back to the Vietnam war where presidential candidates would reach out behind the scenes to the North Vietnamese government to determine potential war policy.  &#x200B;To be clear I am no fan of Trump (I actually voted for Hillary).  But from a centrist perspective this is what it looks like: Democrats still can't accept that Trump was legitimately elected because his election invalidates their identity-politics based world view.  They have put all their eggs in the collusion basket and that has been proven false.  They look desperate like they are grasping at any straw to get rid of him.  The mainstream media has long ago stopped objectively reporting anything even remotely related to Trump.  A great example is how minorities are doing better now economically than almost any other point in history (at least in terms of unemployment).  If that had happened under Obama or a Democrat it would be running on CNN every night and Democratic politicians would be falling all over themselves to take credit and talk about how redistribution works so well.  As probably a classic American success story (kid who grew up in the middle of nowhere served in the military paid my grad student loans out of my own pocket have a good job) I'm just tired of hearing how people can't get ahead and how everything is now someone else's fault and that I should pay for it.&#x200B;In terms of obstruction of justice: from a centrist point of view the "justice" he is obstructing is a political party that is desperately trying to remove him and refuses to take no for answer.  It's looking more and more like a witch hunt every day.  Can you blame him?
 ,Might want to check the last few topics on this subject where these have also been covered.> (1.) Do you believe the report is accurate and honest? If not why not?Hard to tell since it was a specific fishing expedition but if they had found anything it would have been non-stop front page news.> (2.) If you answered yes to the previous question are you uncomfortable with the idea that Trump knew about and expected to benefit from Russian interference in the election?No not disturbed at all since Russian interference has been common in our elections since the 1990s. Should we talk about Chinese interference and the Clintons?> (3.) What do you make of Mueller's reasoning as to why he isn't pursuing prosecution and what do you think it means for Trump's ethical position?It means they did not find enough evidence to prosecute which is a safe position for a career pastrami-eating bureaucrat like Mueller. He did what his overlords told him created the media storm they wanted and then found nothing so he can now continue to work his functionary job for a high salary.
 ,Sad part all together Russia can't even run its own "democracy" why they trying to mess with ours?
 ,So question number one: do you believe the report is accurate and honest? If not why not? NAH IT WAS AN INVESTIGATION IN SEARCH OF ANYTHING TO TAKE TRUMP DOWN. IM SURPRISED REPUBLICANS ALLOWED IT TO HAPPENQuestion  number two: if you answered yes to the previous question are you  uncomfortable with the idea that Trump knew about and expected to  benefit from Russian interference in the election?  IF DEMOCRATS ARE HAPPY THAT ONE OF THEIR OWN (FDR) WAS BASICALLY A COMMUNIST ASSET AND SAVED COMMUNISM  FOR THE NEXT HALF CENTURY..... I DONT SEE THE DRAMA HEREQuestion  number three: what do you make of Mueller's reasoning as to why he  isn't pursuing prosecution and what do you think it means for Trump's  ethical position?    PROBBLY DEEP DOWN HE KNOWS ITS ALL A CHARADE  A THEATER TO SMEAR THE TRUMP ADMIN.  ALSO NOTICE THE ONLY ONES CONVICTED WERE LOBBYISTS WITH SOME QUESTIONABLE PAST....  BUT LOBBYISTS ARE FOUND ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.
 ,Question 1: Yes BUT it's from the prosecutors point of view. If the defense wrote the report they could use the same facts and it would sound a lot different. Question 2: The Russian links are a red herring as its stated that Trump had nothing to do with the hacking. And of course the Trump campaign expected to benefit from these emails...they showed some really sketchy stuff like the actual collusion between the DNC and Hillary in the primaries. These emails were made public not by Trump but Wikileaks and you expect the Trump campaign to simply ignore them?  By the time anyone had any idea of who hacked the emails the information was already disseminated. Your question "do you have qualms about the idea of a Republican President who was knowingly helped into power by Russia". "Knowingly helped" implies collusion which there was none of as Russia was acting independently. So for an independent actor the type of "help" I would definitely have qualms about would be things like changing vote totals. However independent actors routinely "leak" classified information which has effects on our elections. We use this information without even knowing the leaker's identity motivations or even their loyalty. The only solution would be to ban the publication of stolen content which I believe would require a Constitutional amendment.Question 3: Mueller mentioning you can't prosecute a President is another red herring as he later mentions he doesn't have enough to prosecute. It would be very hard as Trump gave Mueller unprecedented access and didn't use executive privilege. The 10 examples Mueller gave are basically Trump's reactions to being falsely accused some of which ironically Mueller only knew about because Trump decided not to use his executive privilege.
 ,I hate to answer a question with a question but: if it is conclusively established that the Obama DOJ also knew about Russian meddling but did nothing how would you feel about that?
 ,I'm only going to answer one question in regards to Trump expecting to benefit from the russian meddling.Realistically it's a big pile of nothing. We expect all kinds of things to benefit an election. Terrorist gets shot and killed by an armed citizen before he can detonate a bomb in a crowd of blind orphans gathered to play with disabled puppies? That's gonna benefit us. Russia comes out and openly says "We support the American Democratic Party and find their glorious strides towards communism to be a great example to the developing world"? That's gonna benefit us. Hillary eats a baby on live TV? That's gonna benefit us.These "Russian Operatives" were primarily spreading disinformation and sowing dissent through social media. What was Trump *supposed* to do? He wasn't president yet he had no power over the likes of facebook and twitter. The FBI/CIA was *supposedly* aware of all this anyway. So what was he really supposed to do besides shrug and enjoy the extra three people who were swayed to vote for him?I mean unless theres new info coming out about him actually working in conjunction with russian operatives it's a non-issue to me.
 ,Obstruction in the defense of liberty is no vice.
 ,I would love to respond to this but I am at work and don't have time so I am leaving this comment so that I remember to come back later on.It is hard to bite my tongue so let me just leave you with a couple of thoughts while I am having a bathroom break. What ties did Mueller find to Russia? Are you talking about the foriegn policy advisors he hired specifically for their experience with foriegn countries? I will come back to expand on this later but the entire investigation was a sham and as much as I don't want to see this tactic continue the Democrats have opened Pandoras box and they have no idea the amount of damage they have caused our country with this scam. Campaigns will now spend money and focus on challenging the election results. Do you remember how Hillary said how dangerous this was? Yeh well when she made those comments [she was actively involved in a plan to challenge the results.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/12/christopher-steele-hillary-clinton-was-preparing-t/&ved=2ahUKEwjosoC6i-nhAhVBmVkKHX-pCsIQFjAAegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw19DG6VM2rMZYqO637KTwOn&ampcf=1)Here is a thought experiment. How would you feel if after Hillary lost team Trump cried Chinese collusion to invalidate her win. How would you explain this video away because I would find it hard to defend Trump if there was documented video evidence of Russians working for his campaign?https://www.weeklystandard.com/michael-warren/video-hillary-using-chinese-exchange-students-as-volunteersAlso how do you explain that the entire investigation was started with information that the Clinton Campaign recieved by paying a foreigner for who then directly recieved the information from Russian intelligence. I am not sure how Trump wanting dirt on Hillary from Russia is a crime yet Hillary is free to pay for all of the Russian information on Trump that she pleases. One was an accusation that did not happen the other actually happened. Why do the Democrats only care about the one that didn't happen?The entire story is a gigantic smear campaign but what is shocking is how many people they have managed to convince. Everyone should read the book Propaganda by Edward Bernes.Just think about this for a second. Imagine if Mueller found out that team Trump was paying a foriegn spy to go meet with high ranking Russian intelligence officers in order to retrieve damaging information on Hillary Clinton in order to ruin his election campaign. That would be the smoking gun that Liberals have been looking for and they would absolutely be able to convince everyone that impeachment of Trump is required to restore the "rule of law" or some other ironic buzzword the media is pushing at that moment in time. However now we know with 100% certainty that Hillary did this but instead of outrage we use the disinformation that the Russians gave her to just further investigate Trump in an attempt to ruin him.The best part is the faux outrage that occurs at the mere suggestion of the accusations orgins will now be investigated .
 ,Question 1:    I believe the report is "accurate" in so far as they're not bold faced lying.   I believe it is also a) wildly full of conjecture and hearsay b) EXTREMELY poorly sourced and therefore c) completely worthless as an actual legal document.    None of what's in it would hold up to much legal scrutiny.... which is why no charges were brought.&#x200B;Question 2:   Take a step back for a second and ask yourself (you colloquially.. not necessarily you specifically) if you're equally concerned that Obama knew this was going on... yet did nothing.   IF you're riled up about Trump... but not riled up about that... that's called hypocrisy and should disqualify you from the conversation because your character and values are not consistent enough to be taken seriously.   Am I concerned that Russians reached out to him... not at all.   Nothing came of it... nothing would... and Trump has shown REPEATEDLY he's MUCH tougher on Putin and Russia than any President in recent memory.   Some seem to be insinuating that we should all be losing our collective minds over things that didn't really happen like some have said they did... and things that were in the end entirely inconsequential.   I am however very concerned that the DNC and assorted Democrats did ACTUALLY collude with foreign powers in attempts to sway the election and commit crimes such as misleading the FISA court.   It now looks like Obama engineered much of that himself and it was done with his knowledge and his blessing.   Again if one is glossing over that and instead losing their mind over some things that could of happened but didn't... that disqualifies them from the conversation because again lack of values and lack of adult like reasoning.   &#x200B;Question 3:   The purpose of the report is to serve as a document to rile up congress and rile up the public to assault the President (there's a reason Mueller chose only rabid anti-Trump vitriolic lawyers many of whom have very little experience as actual prosecutors especially in a situation like this)... and his finding so far as the OLC is concerned fits with that.   He and his team of angry democrats know there's no "there there"... so of course he's not going to charge the case because if he did... he'd have to fight it on LEGAL grounds... which would never go anywhere.    So since he knows that's a dead end... the point is to turn it into a POLITICAL case which has almost no standard it has to meet.   Only the angry musings of a bunch of hysterics matter in that case... and in which case Muller has given the angry hysterics plenty to get hysterical over if they want.
 ,1. No the sole fact that Andrew Weissman and Jeannie Rhee were apart of the SCs team is as absurd as using oppo research to file for a FISA warrant on a cooperating US citizen.Ill answer 2 and 3 though the contacts were both unethical but toothless. There is evidence to suggest that the Russians were trying to inflame the rhetoric on both sides the actual effects that they had are debatable but ultimately grossly exaggerated.Lastly I have quite a few objections to the obstruction portion and how its being used in the public narrative.  Mainly revolving around the start of the Muller investigation and the complex/untested legal quandries that are dubious at best.I am by no means a fan of Trump but this whole thing reeks worse than Trump being an idiot.If you want a professional who was at the top of his fields lay explanation about this I absolutely suggest you listen to the Andrew Mccarthy podcast he does a great job of breaking down the issues in my veiw.
 ,Question 1: Accurate yes. Honest not really. The scope of the investigation was kept deliberately very narrow. So the question wasn't "what happened?" the question was "Did this specific crime happen in this specific way at this specific time?" Which allows for the obfuscation of context as well as *other crimes that might have been uncovered.*Question 2: I'm not *that* bothered by the idea of other countries meddling in our elections *at the level that Russia did.* First of all we've meddled in other country's elections so it's a bit hypocritical to get all bent out of shape about it. It's further hypocritical because foreign governments have meddled in US election before and we didn't get nearly so upset about it until the Democrats and the press (but then I repeat myself) got butthurt enough about losing an election to actually do something about it.Third if I'm reading the report correctly the extent of Russian interference was using bots to spread inaccurate and misleading information on social media. Lots of entities were doing that and I don't find it reasonable that we're exclusively upset when they're foreign governments and not in other instances.Question 3. This isn't surprising as Mueller said this from the beginning. The justice department as a matter of both policy and legal authority do not indict sitting presidents. It's largely irrelevant to Trump's ethical position.
 ,I dislike extremism and think it's unfortunate that those with the most extreme views are the ones that the media hold up as whats typical on the right (Alex Jones Richard Spencer etc) but I think the left has a very distorted image of how popular these views are. I think the number of actual fascists and Nazi's in the US is far far lower than what many on the left assume
 ,The problem with the "far Right" is that too many are Leftist hybrids (National Socialists Fascists Libertarians).As a result they tend to favor symbolic victories and direct action over time-honored indirect solutions.
 ,I think "far right" is a concoction of the left to demonize normal conservatives and paint us in as hateful a light as possible.
 ,Could you explain what you mean by "far right"?
 ,ancaps or white nationalist?
 ,Okay so i’ll chime in with some personal experience.I was never an “ethno-nationalist” or a fascist but I was very far right politically at one point when I was extrememly anxious and depressed and blamed all my sadness on others.I’m not saying that these people are all depressed but fundamentally those sorts of politics attract despair-like mindsets. I think many young people are frustrated in todays society and then take whatever side they align with to the extreme because it makes them feel like they’re saving the world instead of laying around feeling bad.I think far-right politics is dangerous and gross because like Marxism it reduces everything down to a good/bad binary where your enemies are clearly defined by what they are rather than who they are.Feminist? Enemy. Leftist? Enemy. Anyone not far right? Enemy.Far-right politics are reactionary and the end goal is tyranny. It feeds on dehumanization of other people. Even if Richard Spencer gets his way with his “ethnostate” there will always be a group to scapegoat.I’m still right-leaning pretty firmly but I try to keep an open mindset and have changed my views on alot of issues through conversation and research rather than edgy subs and 4chan.
 ,What do you mean by far right?
 ,I refer to people like that as "The left of the right". They're essentially our extremist wing. Equivalent to the people who claim that billionares should be arrested and Trump is a fascist dictator. I hate to bring out names but the people who I often refer to as far right are people like James Allsup Richard Spencer (obviously) I guess Alex Jones however I think if anything its more of a character then who he is Irl I guess Milo and a few others.People like them especially those who have a following online are often attracting those who saw the feminist rage compilations and said "This is all politics and anyone who disagrees is like this". Essentially the people who use the terms "Libtard" and "Snowflake". It's because of people like this that the media finds time to criticize us and claim the internet is turning people into extremists.
 ,I am not a fan of extreme politics period. Far right far left it doesn't make a difference to me when it comes time to my being off put by them.With that said I would like to ask a follow up question. Do you mean far right in terms of nationalism/fascism or do you mean far right economically which would mean something like anarcho-capitalism?
 ,The term "liberal" originally meant someone who supported freedom but because that requires egalitarian assumptions it was absorbed into the larger egalitarian movement called Leftism.[Leftists are egalitarians conservatives preserve order.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/conservative)
 ,Liberal is generally pro-progress and skeptical of tradition which of course contrasts the traditional preferences of conservatives.  However the term Leftist is used to emphasize the hardcore liberals who are firmly anti-tradition and happen to support policies like strong government control of one’s life and censoring of speech which are historically authoritative stances.  Basically most conservatives these days prefer tradition and less government involvement.  Most current liberals are skeptical but not entirely dismissive of tradition and prefer a moderate amount of government.  They’re just fairly moderate so I have no issues with that.  Leftists are anti-tradition in general and want strong government control which is noticeably different in practice than your average liberal view.Honestly it’s mostly a product of conservatives viewing themselves as classical liberals and wanting to retake the phrase “liberal” from the far left.  Leftist implies a more extreme left-wing stance and is analogous to alt-right if that makes sense.  Both groups are authoritative and extreme.  It’s a convenient way of identifying the people conservatives see as far-left nutcases and others as ordinary left-leaning moderates who we’re generally cool with.

 ,I don't like to use it I don't like grouping people but it's a way to describe people further left than Liberals in the political sphere. I'd classify myself as more Liberal than Conservative. Democrats have just gone so far left that Trump is starting to look closer to Liberal values than the Democrats are.
 ,It's an easy way to point to an extreme version of the democratic party while still differentiating between moderate Democrats and their progressive/regressive counterparts.
 ,It's the same concept behind liberals calling people "alt right". Alt right is a very small number of people on the conservative spectrum. I'm talking about actual white supremacists like Richard Spencer. Breitbart is not alt right and people who read it are not either. They are just a bit further to the right than the standard right winger. But..the left uses the term to lump all conservatives with the likes of Spencer and it basically ends any conversation before it begins cuz they are essentially calling you a racist.
 ,I think the '-ist' postfix is derogatory. Like a believer of  Islam and the thinker of the Left is okay but an Islamist or leftist means they are extremists or dogmatists.
 ,When you look to a more powerful central government to control people's lives and businesses and to enforce compliance with ideology you cease to be liberal and you move toward totalitarianism. When your totalitarianism also leans toward communist/socialist ideas like vast redistribution of wealth that puts you toward the "left" end of the political spectrum. Thus "leftist."
 ,[removed]
 ,Liberals are pro freedom and individual liberties leftists are pro big government(although they will tell you they dint like big government) pro censorship and care more for group identities than individualism. There are quite a few old school Democrat liberals that find them selves more at home with conservative/libertarian movements these day because leftists have moved the democratic party away from core liberal values and toward top down government control.
 ,This is something everyone in America gets wrong due to there only being two parties. Liberals are not leftists they just happen to be to the left of conservatives. Even the most intense liberals are seen as a problem by leftists for not being "left" enough. There are both very authoritarian leftists (tankies Stalinists) and there are unauthoritarian leftists just like there are authoritarian conservatives (your typical republican) and unauthoritarian conservatives (libertarians. Actual ones. Looking at you republicans) who believe the same stuff but think the government shouldn't be involved in enforcing that morality itself. Live and let live.
 ,Depends who im talking to or about a leftist is someone who favors equality and is anti-hierarchy (Anarchism for example). Liberals are people who accept the current political paradigm (Individualism Capitalism Democracy). I am mostly against both.
 ,Americans have by far the worst lifestyles in the developed world.  That's a big part of the reason why healthcare is more expensive here.&#x200B;Removing the price from a good (by making it "free" for everyone) has never in the history of the world resulted in a more efficient use of the good.
 ,I am of this belief.Accompanying various family members through health crises and end-of-life events I got to see the medical system in its fullness.It resembled a prison.Once they got you into the system you stayed in the system with followup appointments and the like. A few patients took up most of the time and the real winners were those who stayed out of the system.In addition most of the patients took terrible care of themselves. Not just suburban slackness -- forty extra pounds low exercise eats pizza -- but insane excess: smokes Newports weighs 400 lbs eats nothing but junk food and fast food.They take up a lot of cash to care for but doctors and nurses love it because their jobs are that much more secure and then they die at which point the real costs appear. First the various operations to remove limbs and organs then the long descent with many ambulance rides and daily procedures.It also generates a huge heap of landfill.Going through the medical system made me a believer in natural selection.
 ,Bro have you been on Twitter.  People have devoted their lives to mocking a man they have never nor will ever meet.  People have devoted their lives to mocking those people.  Yes.
 ,Religious college educated conservative here. I believe in the vast majority of evolution. I totally understand why people think humans evolved from some combination of homo habilus homie erectus etc. That being said the one exception is mankind. I believe God placed man on the earth as full-on human with a need to develop from a lesser species. If it wasn’t for divine intervention evolution would be the obvious answer and I don’t fault anyone for believing any differently.
 ,Yes absolutely. (Former Christian turned casual Pantheist/Stoic. Solid conservative.)
 ,You're convoluting two issues. Well not just you. *Everyone* convolutes the two issues because it's easier to do so.*Evolution* is the theory that living organisms evolve over time to better suit their environment through mechanics such as survival of the fittest random mutation and selective breeding.*Darwins Origin of Man Theory* states that humans and monkeys share a common ancestor several millenia ago.First anyone who can't talk about the two is not informed enough to have an actual discussion on the topic. And just because someone agrees with you doesn't mean they're agreeing for the correct reasons. For example some conservatives believe that we should want to shut down the border to avoid the social and economic ramifications of an unrestricted influx of undocumented migrants and others want to do it because they hate brown people. In much the same way someone can agree that evolution is fact because they're a fan of science and agree that it's a sound theory while others can agree with you because they just hate religion.That being said evolution is pretty much fact at this point. We literally see it in action every day. Anyone who says that they don't believe in *evolution* is no better than a flat earther anti-vaxxer or fake moon landing... -er.But DOMT is a bit of a fuzzier subject. There's a lot to unpackage in that and we're learning new stuff all the time. There's no reason or evidence to say it *objectively* isn't true but we also don't have enough information to say that it *objectively* is true either. But given the evidence it does seem *pretty darn likely*. But remember we thought dinosaurs were leathery for a long time and just now we're finding evidence they had feathers. We rebuilt a dinosaur wrong and believed in it for longer than we're proud to admit. Fossil records are really hard to make a factual guarantee on.So even though it seems likely someone who says it's guaranteed settled fact is just as wrong as someone who says the earth was created 6000 years ago and man has literally never changed since then. Well. Maybe not *quite* as wrong but still pretty wrong.Source: I'm not an archaeologist but I've watched the Indiana Jones trilogy like a million times.
 ,Yes. However I'm not sure this:>humans developed from animalsis true.I believe we evolved from lesser hominids not "animals". But maybe I'm being pedantic.
 ,Absolutely I do
 ,As an individual I should have the right to withhold my genealogical information from any entity. I should not be obliged to give up this information to the state or to any corporation.Health insurance companies are far too eager to get their hands on this generic information and use it against the consumer forcing them to pay more for their genetic dispositions to certain ailments.  A gene test for APOE 4 (linked to Alzheimer's but doesn’t guarantee it) has been the subject of attention as insurance companies are eager to use this information and force consumers into paying extra for diseases they simply don’t have. Many people go through their whole lives without knowing of their genetic dispositions because while they may increase risk for certain diseases they often don't guarantee them. It's a complete abuse of the consumer.Being forced to give this information up to the state would set an extremely dangerous precedent. Not only is it an overreach of the state's power it's a complete invasion of privacy. If this information was given up to the state then there's no guaranteeing what they might do with it and it will likely end up in the hands of these insurance companies.
 ,I think it’s insane to give up your dna to those ancestry and 23 and me places. I can’t believe people do that for what basically amounts to a Facebook quiz of you are 20% this and 30% that. It’s not like I intend to do something where they use my dna to find me but what about my kids or other relatives that my dna could implicate.I think that will become the big dna database sooner or later so best to stay out of it.
 ,Our current legal framework does not allow for us to do anything but most of us probably dislike it.The fact is that companies like 23andme Facebook Twitter and Reddit are a new type of company: a private entity that provides a utility-like service.We had no problem extending the later amendments to force companies to be egalitarian; why not the same for privacy and free speech?
 ,When I went to college I had one instructor who made us read Carl Marx and write an essay about why communism is good and work has no inherent value. When I wrote an essay that didn't agree with that she failed my paper despite it being a technically well written paper.I had two instructors who openly said that they were politically liberal and we needed to follow that in our communications with them.A petition was spread around to the staff to disolve the Young Conservatives group on campus. The YC group was was heavily focused on charity drives and open group discussion. They had to meet off-campus to finish organizing their canned food drive.This college was in an extremely conservative town. I can only imagine what it's like in a divided or liberal area.I worked for a college later. They refused to renew my contract because I refused to get a "safe space" badge for "supporting student welfare". Despite the fact that I was well know as being friendly to everyone well liked by staff and students and even had student groups begging me to be a faculty peer for them once I was brought on for full time.So... Yeah I think they have a heavily liberal slant.
 ,Yes because education attracts those who cannot succeed elsewhere or are trapped in a mental state of fixation on childhood.There are some great teachers out there but most of them are alcoholics projecting their own failed lives onto the children.This is why conservatives have advocated for abolishing public education and going back to tutors.
 , ## Does higher education have a left wing bias?  YES##  If so why do you think that is?  --- Most professors lean left or are openly communists. also it seems not many conservatives are interested in teaching jobs. So leftist professors are free to impose their views on history and other social "sciences"  and teach that as "the truth"## If not why is that a common talking point?   Left-leaning msm is only interested in things that trigger their base and viewers and this inbalance in academia isn't a problem for them
 ,It depends greatly on the field of study.  I'm an accountant.  All the professors and every student I talked to leaned right.  For some reason the business building had some rooms in it for those with a dance major.  From conversations I overheard they leaned pretty hard left.
 ,>Does higher education have a left wing bias?generally yes any specific general education course would be somewhere from non political to far left. Once I got into the core engineering topics there was less political over all.
 ,The implication that we hate anyone who isn’t a white Christian is sad.  Most of us truly want the best for everyone.Wanting a small government doesn’t mean we hate the poor.We aren’t always dismissive of left-wing ideas.  Some of them are pretty good or at least have some merit.  It’s not like we just ignore any left of center concept.Conservatives prefer tradition but that doesn’t mean we always oppose change it means we are skeptical towards it.  For example basically everyone is fine with the LGBT community but some are concerned that it goes against the tradition of man-woman marriage.  That’s not an anti-gay stance so much as it’s a pro-tradition stance.  For what it’s worth I don’t have any strong feelings on the matter and I am as skeptical of tradition as I am progress.  Nothing is outside the lens of scrutiny.We don’t all disrespect the environment or believe global warming is a hoax.  I like to conserve things as the phrase states and that includes nature and its resources.  How much of climate change is due to human actions? Idk.  To what extent can we counteract it? Idk.  To what extent should the government control people in efforts to counteract it?  Idk.  It’s a more complex issue to us than simply saying “it’s snowing outside so global warming is fake”.  Also a lot of claims regarding “we’re all gonna die in 10 years if X doesn’t happen” hasn’t come true so that’s more cause for skepticism of calls for change.Not all of us like Trump and the conservative establishment.  Trump does some things I like but at the same time he’s an arrogant narcissist and I dislike his behavior.
 ,That we are all religious.  I'm an open atheist and have been for years in conservative circles. Nobody has ever treated me badly or really cared at all among my Republican friends.
 ,Oh thought of another: being desirous of a strong military doesn't make us war mongers.
 ,Overly religious  Russian Collusion  Greedy White Men  That we are Nazis
 ,The racist accusation makes me very sad and frustrated.  Conservatives haven’t pushed any racist policies ever that I’m aware of.  Conservatives just want everyone to be treated the same regardless of race.  Republicans eradicated slavery and elected minority representatives 100 years before the Democrats.  Meanwhile the Democrat Party pushes many openly racist policies and the Left simply can’t see it maybe they do see it and they don’t care.  Many Lefties on Reddit have called me “whitey” (how do they even know?) as if that’s an insult.  This is openly racist and anyone with two brain cells should see that.  I think the Left is actually very racist and it saddens me that I can’t even have that conversation without being accused of racism.
 ,Coming in here with a slightly different perspective - that women can’t be conservative because conservatives are “anti-woman” or that we’re only conservatives because our father/grandfather/uncle/brother was or is. That drives me up a goddamn wall.
 ,[removed]
 ,That we're actively trying to keep poor people poor.We have a different opinion on how to help. We think throwing money at them is creating a culture of "learned helplessness" in which people become reliant on the government. Keep in mind we generally distrust the government and prefer self reliance so to us being dependent on the government is a last resort.Rather we want to create an environment where there are jobs available for the people that want them giving them the bootstraps they need to pull themselves up with so to speak. And nobody can argue that being on welfare is *better* than having even a minimum wage job (unless you're gaming the system). We want to create opportunities at the expense of security. Of course most of us recognize that having a safety net is important to maintaining social stability. So there's some give and take there.
 ,Humans are naturally pretty tribal so it would be very hard to do. Also the more parties you have the less votes nominate a president. So 4 parties 26 percent of the vote elects a sitting president. That's pretty crappy representation. Two parties isn't ideal but atm it's the best and most representative way to do things.
 ,You can no more abolish political parties than you can command the sun to rise in the west tomorrow. Even totalitarian regimes have plenty of factions fighting with each other to obtain supreme power within the system.
 ,> Being coerced to vote a certain way based on party principal's vs yours/constituents seems undemocratic to me.There is variation within the party lines or we would still have the same platforms as in 1789.The main reason we have two parties is that humans split into two groups: the crowd power group and the social order group.Making finer distinctions than that as the Europeans do seems to lead to more time-wasting neurotic chatter which is what makes Europeans as frustrated as they are.
 ,Unfortunately no if you were to merge/abolish political parties it would naturally create more political parties over time. This happened in the past when Washington left office and when the Democratic-Republican Party was the only party left.
 ,>Should we merge/abolish...No to whatever it is. One of the founding principles of the U.S. is personal liberty and upholding the right to free association. There is nothing inherently wrong with the political parties. Individuals are still responsible for voting their conscious. The reason the two major parties are popular is because they've done the best job at casting a wide net. They haven't always been the major parties after all.
 ,Every industry with significant government subsidies or guarantees is insanely expensive.  Healthcare pharmaceuticals military suppliers ect.
 ,Because public funding is usually a small percentage of total funding.  In my state the flagship university gets about 15% of its funding from the state.  Cutting 2% off of that really shouldn't result in a 25% increase in tuition.&#x200B;Not to mention said university has a three billion dollar endowment - enough money to fund 86000 years of student tuition.
 ,This argument is like most Leftist arguments: flat-out insane but with a grain of truth.*Once* we have wrecked education states cutting education funding creates a shortfall that colleges make up by raising prices. *However* this only happens after we have wrecked education by expanding it.We are sending too many people to college and we can tell which college a person belongs at with an IQ test. Our problem is that saying those two things crosses the taboo line.Government wrecked education by dumping a whole lot of free money into the field just as it did with insurance in healthcare and so colleges raised prices to match.The voters thought that they were helping with "equality" in education not realizing that social class is genetic and not a result of "access to muh education" and instead they wrecked it for everyone.This is what happens with voters. Every. Time.
 ,The biggest problem liberals have is this condescending attitude of middle america.
 ,It says that not everyone nor should everyone climb up the social hierarchy. It says that the game starts are different levels of difficulty depending on the circumstances of one's birth and upbringing. It says that the right amount of talent luck and smarts makes a difference.Besides I don't believe we have a true meritocracy as there is a lot of nepotism and curruption out there.
 ,> most of you are poor and working classThese are the people who see most frequently why natural hierarchies are necessary.I would not say conservatives believe in "meritocracy" since in a modern context this means our propagandistic education and its memorization tests.We believe in competence. The natural hierarchy arises from competence.On every work crew someone leads and everyone else has a specialization. If you do not you are on the bottom and everyone knows you belong there. This also protects you from having to do things that your brain emotions or soul cannot handle.
 ,In theory claiming yourself as a Republican means supporting the platform proposed by the party leaders of the GOP; in practice being a Republican means voting Republican: it's likely that someone who votes Republican will agree with most or all of that platform. For example I can't imagine that anyone who is pro-choice anti-gun pro-welfare-state and anti-border would vote Republican.A conservative is someone whose deeply held beliefs and actions coincide with what is historically known as conservatism. (I call it an ideology. Our fearless royalist leader will disagree on that and I'm still a bit fuzzy as to exactly why that is. Doesn't matter terribly much to me.) What historic conservatism means is (among other things): 1) Recognition of Western Civilization and the importance of Judeo-Christian values 2) Placing high value on the traditional family unit 3) Supporting individual freedoms and opposing government intervention and 4) Limited government. I'm sure I'm missing quite a lot but in general from those three principles you're going to see fiscal conservatives social conservatives and your standard conservative who is a bit of both. Social conservatives emphasize the culture war i.e. point numbers 1 & 2 while fiscal conservatives emphasize the third.As others have noted there has recently been significant overlap between the two; such a significant overlap in fact that it seems almost useless to make the distinction at all. Yet the distinction still exists (compare Lindsay Graham against the late John McCain against Ted Cruz against John Kasich and see if all of them even look like they're members of the same party much less the same ideology) and is worth perpetuating. Long after Republicanism falls Conservatism will still be highly relevant.I'm not an expert just a fella so feel free to correct me where I have spoken in error.
 ,>Republican beliefs/veiws vs conservatives beliefs/veiwsI'm a bit confused as to what you mean by this. All it means when you consider yourself a Republican is that you support the Republican party. Most Republicans are conservative and many conservatives consider themselves Republican.There are various views and beliefs held within the Republican party just as there are varying views among conservatives (not all conservatives agree with each other on everything of course.)It's the same thing with Democrats and Liberals. Democrat merely refers to the political party.
 ,Conservatism is a philosophy; Republicanism is an instance of that philosophy based in a political view adapted to gaining votes in America and supporting the non-profit corporation that is the Republican party.Conservatives exist on a spectrum just like Leftists; a Democrat is 40% Leftist while a Communism is 100% Leftist. In the same way a basic Republican is probably 60% conservative while an Old Right person would be 100%.Leftism is the belief system of egalitarianism or equality enforced on all where conservatism is the belief system of [order](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/conservative) preserving the best of the full historical past and carrying it into the future.During a time of democracy equality and pluralism conservatism is the odd man out so Republicans are partially Leftist in order to appeal to their audience.
 ,Conservatives believe that the government should only intervene to help those who cannot help themselves. Republicans believe that some government solutions are necessary and important even with those who can help themselves.
 ,Taxes. Cut entitlements and you can pay for everything with a simple sales tax on luxury items or pollution-heavy items.Yes I think the person buying a V8 for anything other than a work truck should pay twice as much as the person getting an L4 car to commute.
 ,The question isn't how we pay for it but what we will do with all the money we get from the investment of better roads!Seriously though its probably a question better left to each state.  The road needs of each state are very different if only for climate differences.  Cold weather conditions will chew up roads much more than the desert conditions of the south west.  You will probably have less electric vehicles in the fly-over states than you have in southern California.
 ,I'm all for donating to charity but regulating it would be a mistake in my opinion. We already "give" so much in taxes I may need that 5%!
 ,I'm all for private charity but I think the whole point of why conservatives favor private charity is that unlike welfare Americans can voluntary help the poor through donations not through force.&#x200B;IMO I prefer having federal social programs reduce by handing down such programs to state governments and letting them decide how to spend their programs and setting up their own.
 ,At this point I favor only flat taxes. You vote you pay you work. It is that simple.
 ,If the nation can survive without those programs having guaranteed funding (vs hoping people choose to give to them) then why not just cancel them outright and let people decide whether and how much to give to charity on their own?If you mandate charitable donations the first thing everyone will do is follow in the celebritys’ foot steps and set up their own “foundations”. Then they can make charitable donations as required and receive that money right back as salary for administering the foundation.
 ,Leftists think that Planned Parenthood is a charity so no.
 ,It sounds like a nice idea on the surface but what often ends up happening is that most money which publicly funded services earn ends up in the hands of bureaucrats. Charity generally works best when its personal.
 ,Why would he trust that anyone asking for them has any honorable intent?
 ,Why should he?
 ,Several reasons&#x200B;1. The attempts to gain access to them are out of spite and hate... and they will use anything and everything they can for hateful and spiteful purposes2. It's none of their business3. There is propitiatory business information in them that could severely harm his business interests.    Should Hilton be required to dump all their tax info also?   What if Ford convinced congress that GM's taxes should all be made public so they can develop strategies to attack their most profitable enterprises or engineer schemes to harm their future endeavors?   &#x200B;A better question... is why do you think his business dealings before he became President are any of your business?   What makes you so special  you think you're owed access to that?   Who else's taxes do you think you're owed access to?
 ,Honestly I think there's a disconnect here between the reasons he *won't* and the reasons he *shouldn't*.He *shouldn't* because the president is still a citizen and he's still very much got a right to his personal privacy. And even if his tax returns are squeaky clean his political opponents will find anything they can take out of context and throw it back at him. Case in point the "I'm **sexually intercoursed**" quote from the Mueller report. Simply put he recieves no benefit from doing so. The only people who will really criticise him for it are people who aren't going to vote for him regardless.The reason he *won't* is because he's doing what no republican president has done before him: openly and brazenly thumbing his nose at the opposition party. Politically it's the right choice. His base loves it and the center swing voters generally see it as another instance of the democrats being childish (at best) or vindictive (at worst). When the election comes aroundhe's going to rally his base by bringing up investigations his taxes and (maybe) impeachment then transition that into "America is better now than when I started and they hate me for it!"
 ,I think Uber was right to fire the driver Uber's drivers shouldn't be pushing their personal views onto customers just like any other business shouldn't.  How would we feel if the driver refused to drive someone to a GOP campaign office or gun store ect? That being said I don't think she has a legal claim of any kind here and trying to sue the driver seems unnecessary.
 ,If it is against his beliefs to support abortion he should not take her any more than he would drive a killer to the location of a planned murder.This situation will show exactly why America is heading toward dissolution. To one half of the country she is a murderer; to the other half she is having a minor medical procedure.To be good to one is to be irretrievably wrong to the other.
 ,Uber did the right thing firimg the driver. He is an employee who refused to do what he was hired to do.
 ,Lady can find another Uber or a taxi or a bus. This is in no way a violation of her rights. It would be a constitutional violation to force the man to drive her. He shouldn't be fired IMO but it is well within Uber's rights to do so. No he shouldn't be sued and the suit will likely be thrown out
 ,The article was a little vague on some of the details but I don't think this is an earth-shaking event. From what I can tell he did offer to take her to an alternate destination and she refused. Regardless of her response he probably should have refunded her fare (if Uber's system lets the driver do so?) but article doesn't say if this happened or not.He's already been fired and I assume the abortion has already happened - so to me that's end of story.Suing him seems a bit frivolous at this point. She said she reached out to a lawyer but "nothing has happened" so I'm guessing the lawyer saw it the same way too.
 ,I have no problem with Uber firing the driver... because he didn't live up to his role.&#x200B;Suing him... is laughable.   You do not have a right to command someone to drive you somewhere.   Shows just how loony liberals are... they think everything that offends them is some sort of actionable issue... that they have a right to never feel things they don't want to feel.   This is what insanity looks like.
 ,Sure.  The question is why we only hear the beginning but not the end of Trump's thought on that.  Here's the key piece redacted by the haters:>Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency.  **It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything.**That's the ***why.***Question for you:  Why would everyone leave off that part?
 ,According to the report he did say it. However if you read it in context. He meant there will be a dark cloud over his presidency. Seriously the fact that they aren’t giving the context means they are actively trying to overthrow imo.
 ,Not a trump supporter but yes although it's taken so far out of context that it's sickening. From how I read it he's clamming that the level of partisanship that he's now facing will make it nearly impossible to successfully push anything. The same thing many who glorifying this qoute complained was happening to Obama.  I also think it's hyperbole but that's another topic
 ,from Page 290 of [the report](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/04/18/mueller-report-searchable.pdf):> According to notes written by Hunt when Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed the President slumped back in his chair and said "Oh my God. This is  terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I'm f*cked." The President became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation stating "How could you let this happen Jeff?" The President said the position of Attorney General was his most important appointment and that Sessions had "let [him] down" contrasting him to Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the President said to him "you were supposed to protect me" or words to that effect. The President returned to the consequences of the appointment and said "Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't  be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me."If you read it in context there is nothing incriminating. If the FBI knocked on your door today and told you they were investigating you for a crime you didn't commit you would be understandably worried as well.
 ,Yes.   It's what a normal non lunatic non robotic NPC person would say when faced with those things.
 ,sure he said it.   It's a normal reaction to finding out that the justioce department will now have free rein to investigate you and control the narrative .   The thing that makes him unique is that he doubled down and it did not end his presidency.    Now my question:   Do you believe that HRC said to Donna Brazile " ‘If That F-ing B*stard Trump Wins We All Hang From Nooses’.    ?
 ,It did happen but only because Trump thought the investigation would kill his chances at reelection by preventing him from delivering on campaign promises.On that note I feel like a lot of the things the dems claim were collusion was more often then not Trump putting his foot in his mouth but not actually doing anything illegal.Trump has the finese of blunt force trauma but that doesn't mean he's some sort of criminal mastermind working with Russia or that he's russia's puppet.Of course it wouldn't surprise me if the dems took a guy they knew was full of qoutable malapropisms and investigated him precisely because they thought he would implicate himself and guarantee them an impeachment investigation and several won elections. Now they're gonna get investigated under the same logic because they chased the russia thing too hard.
 ,He said that but didn't mean what they say he meant. You should have noticed by now that the media tries to spin everything he does in a negative light.
 ,Yes. Not a great comment but the Presidency is still a job and with that it brings normal concerns. Just like everyone else mentioned the other line giving context explains the situations. If all of your advisers are saying that independent councils ruin your presidency then any non-politician could have the same reaction.
 ,No but I do find it funny that even today we still rely on someone with a pen and pencil instead of a voice recorder or tape recorder. Or even a camera
 ,Yes I think so but I think the Left cannot understand the difference between someone who obscures his intentions and a liar.
 ,Not really but even if he did I don't really care. How many Americans make off hand comments when things don't go their way? It's not the smoking gun the left is desperately searching for but it's all they've got so they hang on to it.
 ,Yes but it's not an admission of guilt.  It is like if I got audited.  I'd say something like "This is the end of my business.  I'm F-d" too.  I'm sure that I've done my taxes correctly but I have to get 5 years or so of tax returns and go through the whole thing and if I made an honest mistake somewhere I'm paying fines.
 ,Yes he said it but what he was talking about was blow wildly out of context by the left wing media. He was talking about the independent counsel which tends to grid lock everything and there for would have kept this all lingering in 2020 also paints a picture that he's arming up to fight in court which makes him look guilty. Also a lot of why sessions was awful and was making bad calls. Hence why he got fired.
 ,Reason #1:  The Democrats have gone crazy.
 ,Another conservative SCOTUS nom
 ,I don't want socialism in 2020. That alone should get Trump elected.
 ,Trump is doing well:https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/trumps-list-289-accomplishments-in-just-20-months-relentless-promise-keepingIn particular:* Renovating the military* Keeping focus on immigration* Removing regulations* Making courts less Leftist echo chambers* Pushing back against the media* Clearing out careerist bureaucrats* Sensible foreign policy* Balancing artificial trade deficits* Making Europe provide its own defense* Renegotiating NAFTA and other treatiesNo one is perfect and American presidents are limited in what they can do but so far Trump is doing *great*.I have a wish list of course but that is what 2020-2024 are for. We are doing better with Trump than we would have with another Bush McCain M.C. R-money Zodiac lisping Rubio bricklike Kasich or any of the other goons that "the system" has offered up.History will record Trump as one of the best American presidents especially since he has reversed the [utter disaster of Barack Obama](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/barack_obama/) and given America a coherent forward direction instead.History will also show that after almost two centuries of creeping Leftism there was only so much that he could do.
 ,Hes better then the alternatives.
 ,To be frank he only gets my vote because all the alternatives so far seem to be very far left leaning Democrats and voting for any other running Republican is a wasted vote due to Trump's current popularity. Lesser of two evils tbh.
 ,Unemployment has remained at or below 4% for 12 months the longest such streak in nearly 50 years. The U.S. posted nearly 7.6 million open jobs in January there are now 1 million more open jobs than unemployed persons.
 ,Because he's an EXTREMELY effective President.
 ,His past four years have been rather good to the nation. The economy is practically experiencing a golden age unemployment is down and it seems were building infrastructure everywhere these days. The nation is safer; we don't see the same riots and race problems we saw under the Obama administration and the amount of terror attacks are lower as well. He's done a lot to stop the opioid epidemic which I like quite a bit. Our foreign position seems strong - were talking to enemies were used to never speak to we've decimated the ISIS threat and it seems were making new trade agreements all the time. Honestly I can't think of a reason not to support Trump at this point.
 ,I’m starting to get a strange suspicion this account is up to some sort of comment baiting.  At the least it is a throwaway account for this sub.
 ,Lesser of two evils.
 ,A take which hasn't been listed yet: voting for Trump in 2020 means that in 2024:1) Democrats can't run on an "I'm not Trump" platform.2) Republicans can run on an "I'm not Trump" platform.If Trump is re-elected then 2024 will (hopefully) see a bit more honest and center feel from both sides. I don't think America is as polarized as we see in media outlets. Democrats will hopefully get back to a 2008 Hillary Clinton and Republicans will hopefully get back to... Is 2015 pre-Trump-nomination a good start?
 ,They are taking a break from being a member of society for refusing to play by the rules. 1. They are being put in time out from a game. Part of participating in that game is the act of voting.2. It's hard to see why an individual who's shown contempt for our rules should have further say in what rules are created. 3. It's also hard to see why an individual who's been removed from a community should have further say in rules that no longer affect them.> Is there a fear of prisoners and other criminals organizing their votes with sinister intent? Do you have any fear of a government with the power to disenfranchise? Would you be in favor of expanding this disenfranchisement to cover more crimes?I don't fear that but some certainly would. No to the last two.
 ,Keep in mind this is all a result of due process. These people haven't been arbitrarily "stripped of their rights". They have received due process under the Constitution. The bigger question should be "Why should someone who refuses to play be the rules of society be allowed to decide how that society runs"?
 ,Let's call a spade a spade: Democrats really don't care about felons much more than any other political party.   Democrats do know however that minorities are more likely to vote Democrat and minorities are more likely to have been convicted of a crime.  Disenfranchisement costs the Democrats votes. Period.&#x200B;This is why Democrats support lowering the voting age to 16 (because those ages tend to vote Democrat) allowing non-citizens to vote (again a higher percentage would vote Democrat) etc.  Hiding political policy under the guise of altruism certainly seems to fool a lot of people.&#x200B;TLDR: Democrats want to expand the voting pool in any way possible.
 ,I have a general rule: if you aren’t giving someone their 2nd amendment rights you don’t trust them enough to argue in favor of them voting except to use them as annadvantageous demographic block. You don’t *actually* see them as deserving the rights of a citizen. Also the primary purpose of incarceration is punishment. You committed crimes and now have lost your standing in society being removed from polite society for a time. It’s frankly an absurd proposal to say convicts should vote and just shows how every time we think the Dems have gotten too extreme they find a new frontier to push into
 ,This is mainly about crime and punishment and what punishment entails. Stripping felons of the right to vote is a lifelong punishment for breaking the law. The idea being if you cannot comport yourself in accordance to the law you don’t get a say in the law. The real crux of the argument comes with what should constitute a felony and should the stripping of voting rights be a lifelong punishment. Many liberals are in favor of lenient punishment and restoring voting rights to felons. Many conservatives are in favor of harsh punishments. On one hand lenient punishments can make possible rehabilitation easier but can also make repeat offenses easier as the punishments are less severe. On the other harsh punishments can be a deterrent from crime but have lasting effects on felons. I believe that revoking the right to vote is a just punishment for felons but I also believe there needs to be an examination into crime and its root causes so as to not only rely on punishment as a deterrent. I am open to talking about a possible method to remove felon status after a certain amount of time. But the typical conservative response is opposition to a blanket removal of the punishments for felon status. I hope this helps!
 ,It would depend on the crime but generally people who can't be trusted to obey the laws of this society shouldn't be able to vote on those laws or for the people who make and enforce them.
 ,> So for those that support removing the right to vote why?Why would you give votes to people who have demonstrated horrible judgment and possibly narcissistic sociopathic or psychopathic tendencies?Societies remove the right to vote from people who have shown that they are willing to act against the interests of the group. Felons in particular are notoriously selfish and unrealistic.If anything we should consider exiling such people except for the fraction of a percent who might rehabilitate themselves. They offer us nothing but servitude as we work to pay for their upkeep and to clean up the damage that they do.There is also a genetic component and for that reason keeping them and their offspring around makes little sense. Ship 'em all to Venezuela.
 ,Prisoners have limited access & exposure to news and events that affect the world that the rest of us live in - so do they know who or what they're voting for? They can easily maintain the right to vote; all they have to do is not commit a felony.
 ,Others have responded to your other points.  We're removing people from society because:1) Punishment;2) We don't trust those people to make good decisions;3) When people are in prison they're effectively removed from normal society so their interest in that society is different than normal citizens.However I wanted to point this out:>Is there a fear of prisoners and other criminals organizing their votes with sinister intent?Prisons are frequently located in rural areas with low populations.  In those circumstances a large proportion of the community is *in the prison population*.  So in those communities the prison population -- if given the same right to vote as everyone else -- would be able to vote their own into power overwhelming the non-prison population's power to vote their own members in.
 ,I don't want someone that's so evil  that they get convicted of a felony picking our leaders.
 ,What the hell. You want felons to vote!?
 ,Maybe you could rephrase your "question" in a less smug and arrogant way??&#x200B;Why do you feel voting is a "right".    Can you show us in the Constitution where that's spelled out?
 ,Harris is the strongest. Personable and ticks all the "identity politics" boxes.
 ,Doubtful.  They’re too far-left to win in a general election.
 ,Anything is possible but the answer is a certain no for the older candidates. For example Biden and Sanders are on their last run. Their age is already questionable in this election but they won't get away with it in another. I'm sure you'll see some of the younger folks such as Booker Harris try again in a few years. Same as Cruz will do in the GOP.
 ,Buttigieg maybe. Bernie Warren and Biden are too old. Kamala and Beto seem like they are already being ditched by the DNC for Buttigieg and Biden. Yang or Tulsi maybe but its a long shot
 ,Krugman is an idiot. A lot of what he predicted was wrong so I’d say you’re wasting your time reading his trash opinion. He has come down with a severe case of Trump derangement syndrome.
 ,Oh it's *The New York Times*. The paper that lied about Stalin Kitty Genovese and its own lying reporters. Should we take this group of Communist propagandists seriously?> So all the “fake news” was true.You can tell that the lying has become. The real "fake news" -- the Russia collusion story -- is now definitively revealed as *not true*.Leftists doubling down on a lie here...> Because the modern G.O.P. is perfectly willing to sell out America if that’s what it takes to get tax cuts for the wealthy.This stupid trope. To the Left any tax cut is "a tax cut for the wealthy" since Democrats always take from the productive to give to the unproductive (especially themselves).In reality Trump gives a tax cut to the middle class and the wealthy benefit but mostly the middle class benefits. The Left who consider themselves nu-aristocrats despite having none of the attributes of aristocrats look down on the middle class.> By large margins the American public believes that corporations and the wealthy don’t pay their fair share in taxes. By even larger margins the public opposes cuts to safety-net programs like Medicaid. ¡Oy vey! ¡Caramba! ¡Mein Gott! They *oppose* them! They're going to have to get over this because these programs are bankrupt.
 ,Propaganda. You can tell from the headline and if that isn't convincing enough the sub-headline drives the bias home. The story itself reads like a person with a grudge and is far more emotional than factual. This is a piece written to create emotions and written specifically to a left wing audience. It's left win propaganda and it's not that surprising given the source; simply a dog whistle to those in the left wing side who are angry and hostile to the President.
 ,Paul Krugman is a hack and has been for years.  I read an interview with him years ago where he admitted that his wife edits all his pieces to make them more liberal -- so he's not even his own hack he's his wife's hack.  He was once a respected economist (although in a very narrow field of economics) but his opinion articles often contradict stuff he's written in his own textbooks (which he wrote back when he was doing actual economics and not being a political partisan).Disclaimer:  I did not read the article once I saw who wrote it.

 ,How's about printing an excerpts or two.  Neither your headline nor your posts gives us specific info other than it involves Trump and the Republicans.
 ,It's something you constantly learn.... and constantly re-examine and re-affirm.&#x200B;What's most important to me today at 40 isn't what was most important to me at 20.    But in any event... I'd argue what's most important in life is a healthy respect for how precious and fragile it is (life).    Once you appreciate that... I think everything else just sort of falls into place.
 ,Live your life as you want and not how others want of you. If you spend your life doing what others think are right but end up looking back and realizing that you did nothing of value or worth...that's your problem. Make sure you go pursue things that you want you can succeed in and that you can look back and be proud of.
 ,I'm about your age but what you're looking for is self-actualization. That's a fancy way of saying "figuring out what's important and making plans to pursue it."Me I love creative writing. I'm also very passionate about education. I love to hike read books and drink fine bourbon & martinis. Those are all things that I identified as fulfilling to me. From my faith in a Creator God I believe that those are the things that I was created to do; that belief seems to be borne out by my success and joy in pursuing those things. Those are the things that "actualize" me; they give direction and purpose to my life in the moment instead of those far-off uncertain goals that we all aspire to.It's not as simple as finding what "makes you happy" because happiness is fleeting. Drugs and pornography may make you happy for a few minutes but they're ultimately destructive. Reading writing teaching and drinking (in moderation) are things that bring me joy. The difference is that joy is long-lasting a state of being rather than a transitory emotion. Identify those things that bring you joy and pursue them. It may be strange (I'm trained as a mathematician I shouldn't have any business in creative writing; but I'm *good* at it) but that doesn't matter: if it's healthy and brings you joy those are the things that will actualize you and draw you out of that mire of aimlessness you seem to be stuck in.Although I haven't read him myself Jordan Peterson's book "Twelve Rules For Life" seems to have been a very helpful resource for many young men in your position. If you hold to any faith beliefs you might try reading John Eldredge's book "Wild At Heart" which I have found tremendously helpful in my life. Your mileage will vary with both I'm sure.
 ,The real long answer deserves far more than a reddit post. The short cheap answer: Honor your ancestors. Work hard to achieve the things you desire. Make sure the things you desire will bring out the best in you instead of making you a slob. Accept the reality that many of the best things in life (career relationships) require sacrifice. Don't be an undue burden to your family or to the rest of the world. Avoid irresponsible behavior with alcohol and other substances. When you start a family love your children and raise them appropriately. Be a man that women desire and that other men admire. Keep yourself fit in mind and body. Respect nature (don't seek to fight it the way leftists do).
 ,I'm a 40-something conservative. I've figured it out for myself at least.Life's greatest satisfaction and contentment seem to come from the immaterial and not the accumulation of wealth or "things". More so satisfaction can be found in service to others. That's not to say you have to deny yourself but rather that you try and put others *needs* ahead of your *wants*.So if you meet a girl don't let the goal be that you *want* to sleep with her. Let it be that she *needs* a man that is decent kind attractive and intellectually stimulating. And realize too that a lifelong commitment with the right person is worth infinitely more than a one night connection with several.Same thing goes for your work. It's great to be ambitious but your climb will be better and easier if you work to serve your co-workers rather than screw anyone over.And as a conservative I have to say this: There is no more important thing to me than my faith in God. That above all else has helped keep me focused and comforted through any of life's struggles.
 ,It comes from a statistic that doesn't even state events or instances of when it happened.. You see the left are constantly trying to get right wing talks interviews QA'S  speeches  lectures  etc shut down over " hate speech" . Ben Shapiro lectures are often victim of this. Hate speech and words are  apparently violence by their definition so every lecture  speech  etc would be considered violence by their definition. So when a statistic does state instances of this " violence happening" for all we know they're talking about lectures and talks. It's complete garbage.
 ,The statistics they cite often lump radical Islamic terrorism and violence with no clear political motivation as 'right wing' to inflate the statistics.
 ,It wasn't on the rise. Mainstream media uses the worst of the worst that have right wing ideals in order to paint the entirety of the right in a bad light. But like you said the right does the same but they don't have the same media power as the left
 ,maybe before just a few years ago there was about ZERO terror attacks that could be attributed to right wing extremists.  So  if we  count the attack at New zealand its 1 > 0....oooh an increase of 100% !!!  the horror&#x200B;Curious how the prevalence of muslim terror attacks ( including  last sunday's in Sri Lanka) isnt  such a  big concern ofr media and liberals.
 ,It's a counter to the fact that left wing violence is in fact rising through groups like ANTIFA and BLM. The left can't deny these groups their views or actions so they've created unverifiable boogeymen to say "*oh well what about...*".
 ,Do you have a source for or against the idea that right wing violence is on the rise? I did a quick google search and found a [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-the-united-states-right-wing-violence-is-on-the-rise/2018/11/25/61f7f24a-deb4-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html?utm_term=.a0f6954cd72d) on the subject. They reference Anti-defamation league statistics FBI statistics and their own research but your post implies that you don't trust them. They also discuss how something is considered a right wing or left wing terrorist incident. Is there another source you do trust?
 ,Rule for radicals and the Communist manifesto both describe the means in which you blame your competition for the negative things you are doing yourself. It is the basic Democratic playbook and like racism sexism and so on one only need to look at the Virginia mayor in black face and the Democratic ran KKK whilst they use race to divide the nation.  Keith Ellison Harvey Weinstein and  Justin Fairfax sex abuse allegations that are overlooked whilst they attack Kavanaugh for evident-less allegations via some mentally ill woman. &#x200B;So many more isms the left is guilty of and blames the right for it is no wonder the inner city least educated among us keep them in office based on fake promises and lies nothing more. So proud to see Candice Owens setting the black community straight for those that will listen.
 ,Because you won’t get banned here for asking a liberal questions.
 ,We aim to be both tolerant and have high standards.Therefore if you come here you will get a straight answer with the usual Reddit chatter/bickering/neurosis removed.This is why we tolerate and even encourage the "gotcha" questions. People hear it from their televisions (or YouTube windows) and want to know how Real Conservatives&trade; would answer it.The whole point of the sub is to make informative interesting and possibly entertaining reading for that audience.
 ,A lot of people lately have been mirroring their questions in several of the "Ask" subs. If we give them the benefit of the doubt they're looking for a diverse set of perspectives and answers. Most of the recent examples I've seen that fit your question were thusly mirrored.
 ,Of course not.Impeachment or any prosecutorial effort is supposed to work like this. "We have found definite evidence of a crime so let us investigate what happened and who did it." not "We really feel like this person is shady and did *something* so let's investigate and keep digging until we find something anything.".>obstruct justiceChoosing not to cooperate in your own political demise as part of a low-key coup is not "obstruction of justice".
 ,There's almost zero rationale to support an impeachment.    The Democrats position is basically "he didn't lay down and just let our coup happen without fighting back".    Defending yourself against a coup is not "obstruction".    &#x200B;Will they though... probably... for any reason they can concoct.   The goal isn't to actually remove the President because they know that will never happen.   The goal is to stain his administration enough it harms him in 2020.   So to that end they'll impeach over the fact they don't like his hair.
 ,No. He has not committed "high crimes and misdemeanors." The Democrats in Congress loathe the man and are desperate to derail him. They're casting about for anything and especially now that they've doubled down on the impeachment storyline they can't back down. They'll keep pulling at any thread no matter how ridiculous.
 ,2 year investigation with unlimited scope and unlimited funding that produced very little evidence. This is a political hit job by those who are angry that Hillary lost.Trump is a bull in a china shop but he didn't "conspire" with Russia to "fix" the election which kills any obstruction charge for me. Damn right he was mad and wanted this BS to go away. I would too. That's not obstruction that's logic.
 ,For what? Winning 2016? Being a right winger? For hurting little Democrat feelings? For not colluding with Russia? For not obstructing justice? For not bending to the wills of Pelosi Schumer Nadler and others? What a joke. Impeachment is not the hill the Democrats want to die on but I half heartedly want to see them try to sprint up there anyway. Not only would they fail but they might even alienate enough people where they won't win elections for years to come. Most people can see by this point their accusations and actions are fueled by hate anger and hostility.Furthermore if we can impeach Presidents on a whim because political parties hate them what's stopping us from doing that with every President? This sets a very dangerous precedent concerning our political stability.
 ,Of course not. I believe it's most prudent to bench these sorts of discussions until enough information comes out that the public can reasonably make up their mind. While the official release of the Mueller report may very likely be that appropriate release of information I think it's clear that there's still more going on behind the scenes. I personally don't believe those investigations will turn anything up; but hey what do I know?The only thing we know right now is that President Trump who was not proven guilty is innocent in the eyes of the law. There is no reason to proceed with articles of impeachment.
 ,No but there are many bureaucrats and a 2016 presidential contender that should be arrested and tried.
 ,Not until ‘straight old white male winning’ becomes illegal. So next year.
 ,Do they have any good reason to impeach him? Last time I check there wasn't any conclusion with Russia.
 ,Are we the party against the elites? **Shucksydoodle** why didn't anyone warn me? Here I thought we were *for* America.(Stupid no-cursing policy)
 ,[removed]
 ,Because the only thing that matters is getting conservative justices on the Supreme Court as young and as right wing as possible. In politics today literally nothing else matters.
 ,I'm not against elites.  Elite warriors keep us safe from terrorism and foreign threats.  Elite doctors and researchers treat us and cure disease.  Elite Bankers and investors have built the best financial sector on the planet.  Elite businessmen have built the biggest companies in the world.  In my opinion the best thing about America is that anyone can become an elite if they work their butt off and find a little luck.
 ,Since when did conservatives ever were against the elite? Conservatives recognize the natural hierarchy of society which again would have some natural elite. While conservatives are against any corruption that undermines the rule of law to say that conservatives are egalitarian like liberals and libertarians is quite silly to be honest.
 ,Still grasping to undo the 2016 election; they are still in shock he won almost like a weird mix of PTSD and a 5 year old wanting a candy bar fit.
 ,According to *them* or according to *us*?To them it's because he's the antithesis of everything they stand for and a realization of their greatest fear: that they've overplayed their hand and America is finally rebelling against theit ideology. This sentimsnt is also being repeated with the resurgence of conservatives world wide.To us? It's because Orange Man Bad.
 ,Independent here.  Trump isnt "bad" imo but he doesnt  share any of the lefts point of view. Idk why dems want to impeach Trump Pence isnt gonna be any better for them.
 ,The Democrats have been riled up by the words of some of the Democrat Presidential hopefuls. Most seem quite upset that Trump neither colluded or obstructed justice and has in fact been exonerated. I'm just ignoring it. The Democrats don't want to die on the impeachment hill months before an election and I really doubt they have the courage to try.
 ,They're continuing to call for impeachment because they bought hard in to the collusion narrative. To back out now is to admit that it was nonsense from the start and that a large chunk of change was wasted chasing after a report based on the questionable oppositional research of a political campaign. Polls show support among democrat voters for impeachment in the 60% ballpark. So admit that you were full of it or keep on pushing narrative that they've been pushing all along which their voters still support and look like the resistance to evil orange man? At this point the Democrats are putting on a show for their voters and the voters are eating it up. Why would they stop now?
 ,Cognitive dissonance
 ,No - I think however they are more "normalizing" of mental health issues."I am not a man I wish to chop of my penis take estrogen and call myself a woman."  Most people would call this mental illness (body image/gender dysmorphia).  The left embraces this as "beautiful."   No it isn't.  Its celebrating mental illness.The right and left have their share of nutters.However one could argue that the lefts "celebration" of mental illness will attract more people to their cause.
 ,Disclaimer: I am a leftist.Many of my friends have mental health issues but I wouldn't call them leftists. "Millennial liberal-because-that's-what-you're-supposed-to-be" would be a better description. Most of them come from rich families in California and their parents are capitalists. Many of them are depressed I think because they're trying to replicate their parents' success in a world that doesn't allow that. What I've observed is that the richer your parents are the more stressed you are even though it should be the opposite because you have the financial security to take risks. The poor people I know are about equally stressed but just because putting food on the table is hard not because they're afraid they won't match their parent's success.This is just my experience though. How about you?
 ,I haven't seen official statistics that prove such a claim but their party does contain a lot of subjects that call out to and attract the mentally ill. Opinion wise yes I do think the left has higher incidents of mental illness in their ranks.
 ,There isn't a clear bi-partisan consensus on what constitutes a mental health problem relevant to this question. The conservatives think that transgenderism is itself a mental disorder and many including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr hold that homosexuality is as well. The Leftists often say that they think "religion" is a mental disorder. (they say "religion" because they have an irrational fear of saying the word "Christianity" like as if somehow the word will sprout wings and convert the whole world should they chance to say it)
 ,probbly many seem mentally unbalanced and depressed and also have problems dealing with reality.
 ,> simplyFirst this word is toxic when we are talking policy. Every cause has an effect and that in turn becomes a cause of other effects side-effects unintended consequences etc.Anytime a politician says "simply" be wary. They are usually either missing something or manipulating you.> increasing the payroll tax to 5% on the employee side and 5% on the employer side or even matching it to social security's rate of 6.2% on both sides?1. Would that cover healthcare costs today? (Probably not.)2. Would it cover healthcare costs in the future?3. What would be the market distortions and impact on healthcare?
 ,To answer your healthcare question: I don't want to pay more for worse healthcare.For the SS they should remove the cap.
 ,>Why not justYou lost me. In my experience every time someone suggest we "just" do something to "simply" accomplish a goal it is *never* as simple or easy as the proposer realizes.Many people are already on a razor's edge of debt and survivability. It's unfair to tax people *more* and then likely give them back *less* than they were getting before.One major conservative principle is that we can't tax our way into prosperity. The best path to success and prosperity is a job. They allow people to earn and save for their own futures.
 ,No issue exists in a vacuum everything is interconnected.Raise income taxes across the board for example and people can afford less in goods and aervices. That means less money being brought in from local and state sales taxes which causes states to require more federal funding. It's a wash.Raise taxes on businesses and the cost of goods and services increases. People can buy less so the businesses have less income to pay taxes on.The only thing that increases tax revenue is improving the rate at which money moves through the economy. Increasing average pay and encouraging consumes to spend as much as possible.
 ,No reason to replace Trump; he is doing great work in the courts and financial realm and we really need him as a second-term president so he can go hog wild with immigration and other crucial issues.
 ,i thought he was a joke at first. i wanted someone more "presidential" like ted cruz. but i've been pleasantly surprised. he's done some great things. i wish he behaved a little differently but putting someone else in the running will only serve to divide republicans.
 ,Gonna vote for him again.
 ,Didn't vote for him the first time. I regret it. Now I'm on board with him for a 2nd term. He is the outsider we need.However I would caution people to not put too much trust in one person. The US government was meant to work with power decentralized.
 ,Better then the alternatives. Probably not a good idea to split the Republican vote tbh.
 ,Trump has done a wonderful job as President and at this point I wouldn't even dream of supporting someone else in 2020. Why stop a good thing? The loudest may be loud but most Americans have benefited from this Presidency.
 ,Gonna be honest:Every time I ask what's wrong with Trump I get told he's a sexist racist misogynistic nazi.These terms have been thrown around so much for the last 10+ years they have lost all meaning. He's racist because he's white he's sexist because he's male and he's a nazi because he's conservative. So those terms mean less than nothing to me at this point and I never get any actually better answers.The economy is getting better. He's keeping promises he made on the campaign trail. I have more money in my pocket and I'm not worried if my taxes next year are going to jump up because I don't have health insurance. He's signing prison reform and securing the border which I can tell you as someone who lives nearby it *absolutely* needs to be done. He's working on social and economic policy that I generally approve of (although lowering business taxes didn't thrill me).He's doing everything we wanted him to do and then some. He's not perfect he's loud and arrogant and he tends to shout off first and think about it later.But overall yeah. I want four more years of Trump.
 ,It's stupid to primary a sitting president.I don't like Republicans but I hate/am terrified of Democrats. If Republicans are socialism with a speed limit Democrats are socialism on a Speed "if it goes under 30 we all die" bus on the autobahn.
 ,Support of course.  He's done a fine job so far.
 ,I support President Trump all the way.

 ,Who else is there? Mitt Romney?
 ,To be  brutally honest id prefer a guy with more ideas and less rhetorics and showmanship like Kasich Romney or Cruz. who could maybe attract more independents.And also being brutally honest. Donald is the ONLY one able to exciite the conservative base to go out and  vote in droves in contrast to those i mentioned who have the charisma of a cardboard.

 ,Is it "racist" to notice that a perp will likely be from a certain background?For example if I am in the hood and I see a white guy in a BMW I assume that he is there to buy cocaine. Is that "racist"?Is it "racist" to notice that in a nice neighborhood bordering a black ghetto most of the perps will be black?Is it "racist" to think that someone who just purchased the ingredients to make a drug cocktail called "lean" who may have been smoking weed and who was furtively evading the neighborhood patrol might have been up to no good?In my view our problem here is that we insist on being race-blind. If a bunch of white people want a neighborhood for whites only and they ban all black people from it then you do not have these issues.In my city we are massively diverse so we no longer have that quaint old "white people are racist black people are poor" thing; instead we have lots of different groups that hate each other and will never admit that in public. The media loves those quaint stories and so they ignore the constant ethnic violence between groups.For example where I live is on the edge of a neighborhood that is changing ethnic character. If there is a shooting here it is most likely a Vietnamese gangbanger lighting up an Hispanic gangbanger while an Indian immigrant walking by is the likely person to catch a stray round.
 ,You should ask pointed questions to expose her bias for example question her about the burden of proof in a criminal trials against defendants or inquire about FBI violent crime data by demographics.
 ,The issue is the double standard as related to anyone else. Also we're talking about human lives for the same reason it was outrageous for Omar to say "some people did some things" when referring to 9/11 that's the same thing. If I were to say about the holocaust "Yeah you know Germany made some mistakes when it comes to Jewish Germans but that doesn't excuse their support of Israel" there'd be a damn near riot. If after a synagogue shooting I carefully manicured my comments to not mention the words synagogue or Jews only a few weeks after publicly wailing when it came to anti Christian violence then people will rightly point out the hypocrisy and suggest it underlies some anti-semitic feeling if I can't even respond to their slaughter by acknowledging what they were.Also pronouns aren't the same thing because LGBT pronouns are an attempt to enforce one individuals subjective beliefs onto a different person who may or may not share it. Calling catholic people killed in a church Christian and acknowledging their slaughter as an attack on the catholic faith is strictly speaking objective no one's asking you to acknowledge that their views are correct.
 ,1. Those LGBT pronouns were made up *just now* and contradict physical reality.  It's like me insisting on being called a horseshoe crab.  That's what the debate is over in that arena.2. Christians have been called Christians since Christ--for close to 2000 years.  Not calling them that *just now* is basically for the same reason that CongressThing Omar said "some people did something."  It downplays the victims in order to pander to non-Christians especially Muslims.
 ,* The LGBT pronouns are made up to force a political agenda* The term "Christian" is not but "Easter Worshipers" is* Both are Leftist provocations
 ,its the hypocrisy and double standard.  Would a liberal be ok if we start  saying "mosque attendants" instead of Muslims?    "alternative sexuality proposers"  instead of LGBT ?   If they get enraged when some trans isnt addressed in the way he/she/it wants----  LOL.Also isnt it strange how at least 3 top democrat politicians  redacted the same term in their tweets?  "easter worshippers" ... asif in accordance  with some internal memo
 ,For me it wasn't so much that the press was trying to erase or sanitize Christianity in a way that they wouldn't do to other victims. For me it was indicative of how lazy and/or manipulated the press is.I'd never heard the term "Easter Worshipers" before and suddenly all the major news outlets were using the term for the same event. Again whether it's the result of laziness or malicious propaganda it demonstrates how the mainstream press is all running the same stories from the same sources with the same agenda.
 ,> Do you think Trump asking McGhan to remove the special council and then later telling Mcghan to deny it is ok for the president to do?Who did he ask him to deny it to? If he is talking about press releases this makes perfect sense; if he is managing information this also makes perfect sense. If he is asking him to give false testimony in a courtroom that is a different issue.> Is he allowed to lie about whatever he wants as long as his policies align with yours?Obama said that if I liked my doctor I could keep my doctor. That was not the case. When do we arrest him?
 ,As head of the executive branch Trump had every legal right to fire the special counsel and the fact that his subordinates didn't do it prolly saved his Presidency due to political consequences.  There is nothing illegal or wrong about Trump acting rashly even if it was stupid.  The fact that he never followed through is a good thing and he deserves some credit for that also.
 ,These are my thoughts as a total outsider here I'd be curious to hear other people's responses: I think that a lot of types of liberalism is pretty anti-religion in general but I don't notice it as particularly anti-Christian. As a Jewish person I think we have a pretty Christian-centric country but I generally don't have a problem with that. I listen to some Christian women's podcasts because I really like theology and people who value religion and spirituality and I think a lot of Christian theological concepts are really beautiful and I like a lot of the family values I hear on such podcasts. I wish the Jewish community had as big of a podcast presence lol. From my perspective as someone who isn't Christian it seems pretty easy to find Christian communities and resources and culture I really admire that and am a bit envious since being part of a smaller religion it's definitely harder to find that mainstream access to your religion. From my outsider perspective it seems really easy to be involved in Christianity and have a ton of resources and communities and people supporting you. I do have an issue when people wield their religion to try to push particular political agenda though. Like I don't like when people say "as a conservative and a Christian" that scares me. I wouldn't ever say "as a Jew and a moderate pragmatist" lol like my Judaism doesn't influence any of my policy positions and I'm really wary of people claiming that their religion influences what they want our country to do. This goes all around though like I'm not okay with very religious Jewish communities that want "personal belief" exemptions for vaccines for instance so I know it's not just a Christian thing definitely all religions can use their religion to try to claim a special place for themselves or push bad policy. I'm not a conservative though but I am "concurious" because I agree with a lot of conservative ideas and values. So I guess as someone sympathetic to conservatism and who admires religion but who isn't Christian I find at least compared to my experiences Christianity seems to have a lot of resources and communities and cultural acceptance in the US and I think liberalism can be too anti-religion but I am afraid of theocratic tendencies amongst certain branches of conservatism.
 ,Yes and no.Yes this society hates Christianity but no it is not targeted at Christianity itself.Any time you have mob rule the mob wants you to be 100% behind the philosophy of egalitarianism and that means that anything which competes -- culture religion heritage family -- must be eliminated.There is a reason that Communist societies emphasized the Party as a family and tried to destroy religion heritage and culture.
 ,Obama Hillary and Adam Schiff called the victims of the sri lanka bombings "Easter worshippers". I'd say there is some anti christian slant.
 ,Well ever since the incidents with the MAGA kids I have notice on twitter a lot of hatred were going towards catholics and catholic school rather than the kids. So an agenda against catholics isn't a far fetch concept as historically catholics have been targeted in the past. But in my opinion I blame social conservatives for the situation that we are in.T hey are too busy pushing their social beliefs on a national level scaring away potential conservatives instead promoting subsidiarity and true conservatism.
 ,There are certain "taboos" within the media/society that are in direct conflict with Christianity.  For example if someone is a Christian and thinks homosexuality is a sin the main stream media has no problem calling that person "homophobic" as if it is a fact that person is homophobic.  So it's not Christianity specifically but some things Christianity stands for.  If you're a "progressive" Christian the medial/society have no problem with you.
 ,In my opinion this is the fault of RINO's in the GOP who have been trying to push their religious agenda instead of staying true to their conservatism.We need to replace RINOS with MAGA canditates in both the House and Senate!
 ,msm lean left and the left has been at very least disdainful of Christianity since the french revolution. There you go.
 ,There is hate on success. Christians have been very successful the last 200 years.
 ,Yes. Frankly I think we should say the media is usually anti-Christian and more particularly anti-catholic. People didn’t even refer to those who suffered in the Sri Lanka attacks as Christian or Catholics or consider that such attacks come from anti-Christian bias. And frankly with all the talk of Christian theocracy as a looming threat from people like Ted Cruz no one talks about a similar threat coming from atheists despite the fact that the Soviet Union was the most oppressive regime in the 20th century in Europe towards various religious groups. I don’t think such a threat exists save for perhaps how atheists want to ban circumcision which is clearly anti-Semitic.
 ,no there is not an anti-christian slant but they do remind us that we are a secular country and not a christian nation.  if that fact upsets conservatives i suggest they read the first amendment and get over it.
 ,There absolutely should be some level of government limitation to what you can do to children. It's uncontroversial to say that parents shouldnt sexually violate their kids (or any) I think making it illegal to give them horse whippings is probably about as uncontroversial. Even as far back as the old testament has a law that is a limitation of parental discipline (saying that parents can't just kill their children but instead children are entitled to essentially a trial by community elders) and I'd say the Jews are better for such a fundamental realization. The question really comes down to health and effectiveness and any limiting law should be through that lens with the goal being involved in parenting to the least extent possible.
 ,If you are willing to perform violence for the safety of the child then yes. Because that’s what it is. A stranger coming to your house with a gun and saying that your kids have to go with them.
 ,In my view there should be no CPS and in fact no laws regarding the family. Lawmakers always expand laws to suppress "crises" in the eyes of the crowd; the crowd whips up non-events into crises to feel its own power and the lawmakers dump out laws in order to feel important. This is a toxic cycle.I oppose government intervention in the family for the usual Big Five reasons that Leftism is terrible; in fact I think you would have to be wholly illogical and insane to support it:1. Wealth transfer: you are taking taxes from the middle class to provide for the domestic disasters of the underclasses who have lower IQs and moral standards and thus are less desirable citizens. Everyone pays for having lower quality average citizenry.2. Introduces dependency: instead of people fixing their own minds souls and bodies they just let government do it which allows them to become intellectual and moral slobs. Slobs then do slobby things including vote for socialism and armchair warfare.3. Against natural selection: if someone exterminates their own family line this is nature cleaning up its little mistakes. Instead our morons save these children because they are "innocent" in the Leftist view or "sacred" in the Rightist view. They are neither; they are the genetic products of failures and we want those genes to exit the pool.4. Expands government: now you have a new agency and that requires an agency to oversee it then some watchdogs then some regulators of the watchdogs then some statistics-takers then some analysts and legal teams and bureaucracies to support them all. Government now has a new power to intervene in your home if you do something that it does not like; it also has a new method of controlling people in that it can write laws which literally dictate when your children will be taken from you.5. Takes moral burden off individual: this seems like the littlest reason but it is the biggest. When you allow people to *externalize* functions costs and responsibilities they lose the mental faculties to manage those things through a process called degeneration which essentially states "use it or lose it" regarding natural traits. People become lazy selfish navel-gazing and narcissistic when they no longer think about the moral consequences of their acts beyond themselves and having government take over those consequences enables them as surely as passing a bucket of heroin to an addict does.
 ,I want to respond to this but am on my phone at work and cannot answer at the length I’d like right now. I’ll try to come back to this later today.
 ,We've put pressure on the Russians and have sanctioned them quite harshly but when we deal with Russia were often imposing consequences for more than one thing. Besides what has any other administration done? Russian meddling isn't new. It isn't even strange. It was constant during the Cold War and we did some meddling too.
 ,> I have heard about sanctions and a back an forth regarding the expulsion/banning of Russians and Americans either countryI am in favor of sanctions specifically against ecommerce with any location in Russia.However I believe this is being handled differently since we know that the Russia-China axis is hostile across the board.The Left emphasizes Russia because the Left has close ties to China going back at least to the Clinton years.

 ,We believe in man-made climate change we just think most of the policies suggested to stop it are stupid.
 ,The majority of Conservatives believe in man made climate change.
 ,What I don't understand about man-made climate change:**How did we cause global warming 325000 years ago?**
 ,While I dont really doubt the current climate science I paise due to the incredible lack of accuracy in the climate forecasts.

 ,The real question is what actual effect/risk it will incur and the cost v. reward of policies to fight it.  Frankly the US could eliminate all fossil fuel emissions tomorrow and it wouldn't matter at all given China/India/ect pollution worldwide.  Furthermore I suspect the Left is just trying to use global warming as a boogie man to effectuate govt takeovers and redistribution.

 ,I do not believe in it.I believe that we are using up *too much land* because we have *too many people* and that "climate change" is simply a distraction from that.Our solution would be to plant a few trillion trees which would require that humanity use only *half* of the land on Earth and leave the rest in its natural state.Of course I do not oppose cutting our carbon use; however mine is already minimal. The rest of you need to do your part especially the poor. Those are the ones who I see failing to maintain their cars causing them to belch smoke and die early buying new gadgets and then throwing them out weeks or months later having a dozen kids and despite being "muh poor" having plenty of money for booze movies cigarettes lotteries parties etc.I would love to see the third world cut its carbon use especially since this is under-measured by Leftists here in the States. The Leftist plan would have us give up our economy give all our money to the third world and let the third world continue polluting. For what? Some enlightened vision of *equality*? These people are insane obviously.Even more I do not see the Leftists around me keeping cars for twenty years avoiding throwaway packaging or limiting energy use. Nope they want government to do that for them.Many of us are simply tired of the paired alarmism and impractical solutions that are the hallmark of the environmental movement since the Left seized control years ago.*Seal the Planet's fate**Crimes they perpetrate**Wasting precious land**It's time to take a stand*&nbsp;*Our only hope to breathe again**To stop the madness closing in**What will we do when all is lost?**Environmental holocaust...*
 ,The "*man'made*" part. Climate Change is a natural process of the planet. We can claim humanity might have accelerated the process in our time but to claim we created it is just plain wrong. Science doesn't scare me. What scares me is those who fear monger with science and then retreat to science as if it's some sort of shield. The types who cheer when science verifies what they believe but scream and curse it when it doesn't. I don't ignore science at all. I follow it quite closely. As for climate change I think there's a number of things humans can be doing to better the planet...but I don't think fear mongering is a solution. I think the left needs to get a grip on reality in this subject.
 ,I believe in man-made climate change.  I don't believe paying people who are unwilling to work is going to stop it.What don't you understand about biology when it comes to sex (I'm specifically talking about transgenderism)?  What about science scares you?  Why do you chose to ignore it in this particular instance?
 ,My major problem is that I've been told my entire life that we're like... 5 years away from extinction. That's not even an exageration.And yet here we are. Year in year out rolling along not dying. At some point you just throw up your hands and say "Either they're lying or they're wrong."
 ,The American conservative and more so the libertarian movement is more "liberal" in many ways than the multitude of leftist movements we are seeing. The progressives being one of the least classically liberal groups today. Buzz words will always be used and twisted around to mean whatever the person speaking wants them to mean. It really doesn't matter what label you put on a political group these days. If it's a more right leaning group pro 2a pro free speech pro due process pro property rights anti interventionism etc. the people that are to the left of that group will call it "far right"or "alt right". I for one am much less concerned with what title a movement has compared to what their actual principles and core values are. I feel that the catchy buzz words most of the media uses on both sides of the aisle to label people and groups are created to push a narrative about those groups and avoid talking about what really matters the things I talked about before core values ideas and principles.
 ,> As both "conservatism" and "liberalism" have had different meanings over time and across countriesThis is not correct.> It usually contrasts with "aristocratic conservatism" which deems the principle of equality as something discordant with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality....in other words the original form of conservatism.> In some countries (e.g. the United Kingdom and the United States) the term "liberal conservatism" came to be understood simply as "conservatism" in popular culture prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly classical liberal values to call themselves "libertarians" instead (see also right-libertarianism).More nonsense since the two are one and the same (Leftists who like some conservative methods).Every public "conservative" is only a certain percentage actual conservative. Since our society has shifted Leftward that percentage on average has fallen.
 ,I believe that it is a great benefit that a company can voluntarily provide to their employees if it can afford it.
 ,This is a departure from my usual individual liberty / let businesses do what they want but in this one case I think we need to depart (and seperate conservatism from libertarianism). The family needs to be something promoted and defended in society. Giving new parents a cushion of time to detach from the world care for their off spring and adjust is positive for them society and in most cases is actually better for the business in terms of their employees happiness and productivity.
 ,I'm against compelling other people to fund it and/or the government forcing companies to offer it as a benefit.  If some company wants to offer it willingly then that's their decision.  If the government wants to mandate that companies allow people to take several months off unpaid for whatever reason then I don't have a problem with that.
 ,It should be provided. People need to spend more time with their children and with people in general.
 ,It should be voluntary decided on by the business with no government involvement whatsoever.It's overrated to be quite frank.  Guys I've worked with and my brother in law all didn't know what to do with themselves halfway through NYS' 8 weeks.  Once they got into a routine they didn't really need to be there.
 ,Companies can do as they wish. However the government shouldnt even consider it.
 ,No government should not force it but I would be in favor of a tax break to companies that do. I don't think men need a full leave similar to a womans. I think men need 1 or 2 weeks tops to help mom adjust but not necessarily. I am lucky enough to stay home with our baby and my husband works and honestly my husband is way happier working than being home all day changing diapers. I think if he had 8 weeks off he would go crazy and so would I too  lol!!
 ,I'm for paid maternity/family leave but I think that each business has a right to decide if they want to offer that as a benefit for their employees.
 ,I have nothing against paid family leave. I'm against compulsory paid family leave many countries in Europe have compulsory family leave. Even if you are the breadwinner you are required by law to stay home and businesses are forced to pay you. Paid family leave is great for businesses that can afford it but not so much for the ones that can't.
 ,Exactly.  If wage slaves are desperate enough to work in dangerous conditions for $2 an hour then let them be free to do so.  Things like paid family leave are a perk that employers can offer in competition for skilled employees.
 ,It's okay if companies choose to offer this. It's not good for the government to require it. Then the companies that really can't afford to pay people for not working will be more hesitant to hire young women. It might help *older* women get hired more easily but it's not a net gain in any way (except for "women over 40").You also incentivize women to *keep their job* after they have kids; you don't want to encourage that for those who don't really have to work. Leave things neutral don't get in the way and don't make a special effort to encourage them to drop their kids in day care and stay in the workforce. The only women who should be doing that are the ones who truly can't afford not to work like their paychecks the difference between making rent and getting evicted.
 ,I absolutely support it a mother needs to be there for their child and shouldn't be exempted from income. After all the mother needs the funding in order to help raise their new born child.
 ,Not the best trolling attempt I've seen all day but credit given for the attempt. The GOP doesn't hate anyone much less the poor. /topic.
 ,The GOP doesn't hate the poor. Well most of us at least. What we hate is the culture of learned helplessness that exacerbates the problem with such a large number of people living in poverty.
 ,Our solution to poverty is different than the Leftist solution.We offer opportunity and lower costs they take from the successful and subsidize the unsuccessful.
 ,This is such a loaded question and a straw man. First of all the GOP does NOT hate poor don't generalize an entire party buddy. And secondly conservatives believe that private charities and churches are best to helping the poor rather than taking someone else's money who wish not to participate. Other conservatives also support state or local governments to establish their own welfare rather than the federal government. Also isn't the whole point of helping thy neighbor means you yourself help the poor instead of forcing someone to do it? What if it's hurting them financially too if you're taxing them to the point of poverty?
 ,People are entitled to their own opinions in a free society but I would definitely say that there are some people who are delusional not because they hold opinions I disagree with but because of their blatant denial of facts and unwillingness to have a conversation with anyone who doesn’t share their beliefs.
 ,People are generally uninformed about things that they don't have very very specific interest and clearly defined incentive to learn about. Critical thinking is a learned skill and it is discouraged in much of society.That said there's a lot of wisdom in crowds -- interesting conundrum...
 ,I think you'll appreciate this post by James Clear: Why Facts Don’t Change Our Minds.> Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing them to change their tribe. If they abandon their beliefs they run the risk of losing social ties. You can’t expect someone to change their mind if you take away their community too.Add to that the fact that 90% of your "reality" is made up by the brain see the post "Up To 90% Of Your Perception Could Be Made Up Purely By The Brain" or read Lisa Barrett.Now throw in the Dunning-Kruger effect which builds on Russell's observation "One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision."So getting to agree on anything is a tough problem.* Language is important. Agree to use the same dictionary and abide by its definitions.* Facts trump theory. This is where people fall down badly. I'm not going to list specific facts that I think create large holes in ideologies as I don't want to get into arguments about specific areas but I have seen this happen too many times. People wear their beliefs like a magic cloak because to be without them is to feel naked.* Tribalism us vs. them is a huge problem. (See Clear above.) It does imply 1) that perhaps people could hold private beliefs that differ from their public beliefs and 2) by changing the group that people identify with their beliefs might change. For example do you identify as Republican or American or human?I think the identity question is the best way out of these disagreements.[Reposted without links because autobot thought I linked to a known source of spam low-quality information or propaganda.]

 ,No for the same reason children shouldn't go to prison for the crimes of their parents.
 ,Nope. Inalienable debt is an idea fundamentally at odds with a free market capitalist economy. Why we have bankruptcy laws.
 ,If a creditor wants that kind of leverage it should be consented to upfront by the debtor in a contract. It would seem reasonable to me that any adult children who agree to take responsibility for the loan in the event of the initial debtor's (ie parent's) death should probably be a signee on the contract as well. If the adult child does not want to assume that responsibility and does not consent to it in a contract I don't see why they should be held accountable.If the offspring in question is a minor I don't think the government should prosecute for failure to pay on his/her dead parents' debt. A minor by nature cannot be assumed to give consent or provide collateral to apply for a loan in the normal course of things anyway.

 ,Animals have no moral agency. They eat other animals. Some even kill other animals just for fun (here's looking at you cats). Even without humans around animals exist on a food hierarchy. When you add humans back in we are simply at the top of the hierarchy. Except of course when one of us ventures unarmed by ourselves around a lion. Then we become food. It's how nature works. We didn't design the system we simply mastered it.
 ,Meat is a great source of protein. Meat especially red meat contains ample amounts of heme iron which has a very high biological value meaning it is well absorbed. Iron from non-animal sources (non-heme) has a lower biological value. Vitamin B12 is only available from animal sources and plays an important role in digestion (stomach acid) and energy production. People who do not eat meat dairy or eggs must supplement their diets with B12. While meat does contain cholesterol (as all animal products do) the newest Dietary Guidelines has removed the cap on cholesterol consumption. Research suggests that dietary cholesterol has very little effect on blood cholesterol.As an aside I find it funny that these leftist vegans are so concerned about the lives of animals but I guarantee you 9 out of 10 of them will also support abortion.
 ,Meat is frickin' delicious and required for a complete and balanced diet (our teeth don't lie).> Because they are not consuming innocent animals that were kept in cramped conditions fattened and later killedIt would be horribly inefficient to let the animals run around or in the case of New Jersey and Jon Stewart (to let the pigs turn around). That burns calories which increases costs of input and production and creates increased scarcity in feed (which would drive up costs for vegans so you can look at this as altruistic in the end).> -Harvesting milk from cows is cruel starves their children and humans have bred cows specifically to make lots of milk which if not harvested can cause lots of pain so we are responsible for torturing cowsNonsense. Source I worked on a dairy farm one summer in High School.> Humans have no moral right to kill animals as they are also living things that can feel pain and sufferingThat's just like your opinion man. We have greatly improved our kill methods over time. The guy that was the basis for the movie Rainman actually invented a device which makes cows extremely relaxed and at peace just before the slaughter. It's not really that bad.> They are being environmentally friendly because the meat industry is a big polluter that is destroying the environment and meat farms contribute to deforestationPartially correct on the environment. There is some runoff from pig farms which can be quite devastating to the local ecology. Deforestation--I have no idea where you're coming up with that.> They are not responsible for wasting lots of recourses because the crops used to feed animals could go towards feeding the poor and the land used for raising animals could go towards growing more food to feed everyoneThat's bull. Everyone always cites the poor as soon as some moralistic answer whenever they don't like something. Yet those same people would never help the poor in any way. Poor people don't eat vegetables (except for the occasional canned veggies from the food bank)--they eat Little Debbie Snacks and get diabetes.Why do people that believe this buy 'organic' which drives up the cost of vegetables through less production and therefore increased scarcity? This is actually a greater source of starvation than meat ever could be. The 'organic' movement is literally a way in which food scarcity is increased as a consequence. Not to mention the risk of contracting E. Coli is 800% greater with organic food versus conventional advanced farming techniques. So no thank you.Another major issue ethanol. That BS makes us choose between energy and food. That's never a decision that should be made energy will always win in the end and that's a horrible thing for poor people.> They are being healthier and can get protein from alternative sourcesThey're not equivalent amino acids. And there are legitimate vitamin/mineral deficiencies that require a lot of planning to deal with for vegans and vegetarians. It's not a lifestyle that I would choose. Food and health shouldn't be that difficult.
 ,I'm a cattle farmer that breeds Black Angus so my input will center around the Beef industry. For the record I own a small scale operation and all of my cattle are pasture fed. They are kept on the pasture year-round and not slaughtered for meat.> -Because they are not consuming innocent animals that were kept in cramped conditions fattened and later killedThis is a result of Industrial Agriculture which sadly often does have horrible living conditions for their animals. The way to solve this problem (which I do think this is a genuine problem) is to combat Industrial Agriculture and return to more people having small farms that put the meat into local markets.> Harvesting milk from cows is cruel starves their children and humans have bred cows specifically to make lots of milk which if not harvested can cause lots of pain so we are responsible for torturing cows.Again the solutions that Industrial Agriculture have developed are often immoral and are harmful to the animals. Watch a video of a large scale dairy operation and then find a video of somebody milking a cow by hand. There is a *huge* difference and whereas the former often alienates the cows from each other and positive human interaction the former builds bonds and relationships between Man and Nature.> Humans have no moral right to kill animals as they are also living things that can feel pain and suffering.As a Christian I have to disagree with this argument. I believe that God gave Man dominion over the Earth to be good stewards of His creation. This means that Man *does* have a moral right to kill animals and especially for food. However I believe that we should be responsible: never kill anything you don't intend to eat outside of self defense.> They are being environmentally friendly because the meat industry is a big polluter that is destroying the environment and meat farms contribute to deforestation.I agree with them on this point. However I must point out again that it is Industrial Agriculture that is the problem. Small sustainable farms have a lot less environmental impact than factory farms do.> They are not responsible for wasting lots of recourses because the crops used to feed animals could go towards feeding the poor and the land used for raising animals could go towards growing more food to feed everyone.Their arguments contradict at a certain point. Most Vegans are Left Wingers who would also agree that humans are not overpopulated. The problem they say is not overpopulation it's unequal distribution of resources. To an extent I think they're right. However there will be a problem when the human population outgrows it's resources. The next step will be to exploit some other planet of it's resources and so on. It's true that larger and larger farming operations cause deforestation and other serious environmental damage but what do they think a growing human population causes? Mass urbanization causes similar if not the same environmental issues that Industrial Agriculture causes. You're replacing an overpopulated group of animals with another overpopulated group of human beings. Doing away with animal agriculture doesn't solve the problem it's a means that justify the ends (the ends being more resources for human beings and less for other species). In fact saying that we should grow crops only for humans could be considered selfish and greedy. Also where do we put all of these animals? What exactly is their "natural habitat" when they've been domesticated for thousands of years? Under the Vegan's policies and beliefs what is the future of chickens cows horses sheep and pigs? Do we just let them go and allow them to roam freely everywhere? If we put them in national parks are we not introducing invasive species to the environment? This leaves only a handful of scenarios for farm animals:* Let them go extinct. This makes the Vegans who preach about humans causing mass extinction hypocrites.* Let humans keep them as pets. Where I live there is a general rule about how much land you need to keep a cow fed on pasture about 1 acre per cow. Out West the amount of land needed might be 25 acres per cow. For people to keep cows as pets it would still take a lot of land. This doesn't *entirely* do away with the problem of farm animals causing environmental damage (And remember this isn't limited to deforestation. Hyper-Environmentalists harp about how cows release Greenhouse gases produce a lot of waste and consume resources that humans could be consuming instead).* Put them in zoos sanctuaries or national parks. This still requires a lot of land and resources. However as I said above introducing them into national parks is introducing an invasive species into an ecosystem that may not be able to sustain them. Then you would have farm animals *still* suffering the way these Vegans claim they would had they stayed on these factory farms. Either way the farm animals would be competing with the animals already there. If the farm animals consume most of the resources in the ecosystem then other animals are going to suffer.Plain and simple pain and suffering are an integral part of existence. I don't think this justifies actively harming animals but who's to say that we're not doing these animals a favor by ending their life?> They are being healthier and can get protein from alternative sources.Nobody is forcing them to eat meat. If they want to get protein elsewhere then they have a right to do that. However tell me who the Fascists are in this situation? We're not forcing them to eat meat but they'd sure force us to get our protein from an alternative source.
 ,I guess meat provides some a large amount of important stuff that is hard to find in vegetables
 ,There's a lot behind the scenes of the vegan push. All those fruits and veggies have to come from somewhere. Usually sourced from over seas (if living in America or Europe) from countries like Mexico. Take the avacado for example.. demand is rising for this delicious snack meaning that more and more avacados are being exported (esp from Mexico). This can lead to deforestation for more farm land labor exploitation or child labor prices spiked in its home land to unaffordable amounts and more fuel to get it to where it's going. So is the vegan lifestyle worth it? I guess that depends on what each person thinks is the lesser of two evils. The other evil being industrial farming that is inhumane and unethical in my opinion.Personally I think the only way to live a validated vegan lifestyle is to source food and product locally (with sustainable eco friendly packaging!). My older brother is vegan and I have many vegan friends. We talk about this subject a lot. The full avacado story here: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/veganism-environment-veganuary-friendly-food-diet-damage-hodmedods-protein-crops-jack-monroe-a8177541.html

 ,It's food. It's healthy in moderation. Humans are natural omnivores. We can fairly easily get by as vegetarians but veganism is very hard to do healthfully because our bodies are built for eating a mixture of plant and animal foods. Especially in a place that doesn't have a long tradition of fully vegetarian diets developed over centuries to be healthy and filling.Factory farming is needed. It's bad but the alternative is worse: poor people can't get a balanced diet. The whole recommendation for 50g of protein a day is too low for most people. That's a minimum not to risk serious deficiency problems; if you're male not petite and/or active you need to aim higher. It helps maintain lean mass too and obesity is a huge problem in the USA. Accidentally putting most poor people on a high-carb low-protein diet because protein and natural fats are too expensive is a bad idea.Humans are more important than cows. If we can treat cows better while doing no harm to humans that's wonderful. If we can't people come first.You can't grow crops where the soil is bad without using tons of extra resources. We eat the animals that eat the plants naturally growing there because those plants have next to no human food value. If you completely get rid of meat you're losing out on food from non-arable land and sea.Dairy cows' calves are not starved; the cows make enough milk for them and us. Also dairy IIRC is the animal food category that yields the most food per animal over its lifetime.We should be taking a critical look at some of the factory farms and making sure they're not being *unnecessarily* cruel. Maybe there are some small changes we can make that will be nicer to the animals and keep the human benefits.
 ,“The concept of the person belongs to the ongoing to dialogue which binds the moral community. Creatures who are by nature in capable of entering into this dialogue have neither right nor duties nor personality. If animals had rights then we should require their consent before taking them into captivity training them domesticating them or in anyway putting them to our uses. But there is no conceivable process whereby this consent should be delivered or withheld. Furthermore a creature with rights is duty-bound to respect the rights of others. Fox would be duty-bound to respect the right to life of the chicken and whole species would be condemned out of hand as criminal by nature. Any law which compelled persons to respect the rights of non-human species would weigh so heavily on the predators as to drive them to extinction in a short while. Any morality which really attributed rights to animals with therefore constitute a gross and callous abuse of them.“ -Roger Scruton from Animal Rights and Wrongs page 81.
 ,The amino acids in meat are essential for humans. Meat contains complete protein. Soy does not and lack those amino acids.
 ,Humans are omnivores. I don't have to justify it. This is nature. Things eat other things. Generally I think vegans are a little crazy. I see those arguments but I don't know why anyone would bother responding to such nonsense.
 ,Gosh how did we survive for 12000+ years thousands of generations just to evolve the mental capacity for you to decide an omnivorous diet is immoral.

 ,It's a double edged sword with no easy answers.  I think you are mistaken to think it's an easy process.  You can place someone in an involuntary hold for 3 days against their will if you truly think they are a danger to themselves or others. Further beyond that to my understanding oh you need a court order.You hate the idea that a citizen might lose their rights and have little recourse to gain them back but at the same time you don't want someone exhibiting red flags and then going to shoot up the school.Most of the homeless problem are due to mental illness and substance abuse. Part of this is due to changes pushed by the ACLU to make sure mentally ill but non violent patience are not held against their will.  So they wander the streets harassing others living in poor conditions and are easily taken advantage of.  Do you lock them up and force them to take medications and have them rejoin society? Or do you let them wander the streets?It's a complex issue either way.
 ,The decision was made by a judge and fought over by lawyers on both sides.  Unless you think no one should ever be declared unfit at all I don't see a better way to do it.
 ,How else would you deal with situations where people have become *non compos mentis*?
 ,I don't have a problem with the idea when the person is a danger to others. Sometimes it's necessary to restrict someone when that's the only way to keep them from hurting other people though we have to be careful to ensure that this doesn't happen except when there's strong evidence that (a) they're actually dangerous and (b) it can't be dealt with in a less restrictive way. I don't think we should be stripping people of their rights just for being a danger to *themselves* though.I'm not familiar with the details of the Spears case so I can't comment on that one specifically.
 ,Citizens making citizen's arrests and enforcing the law is perfectly normal especially when the federal state and local governments either cannot or will not enforce the law. They should be allowed to continue what they are doing.
 ,Got him on a technicality.Our government is not currently functional so we need to directly do the obvious work to be done.  When a river starts to overflow its banks residents don't wait for the government to protect their homes.  Let alone wait for the government to tell us the water should be allowed in for a while until we can decide what to do with it.

 ,Are you suggesting inventories are growing to big?  Obviously someone is purchasing those products or we wouldn’t be producing them.  Do you mean to ask why are we purchasing products on credit?  If we were over producing the economy would be clearly heading toward recession.  Is that happening already?  I haven’t seen that as yet.Could you clarify your question?
 ,Want to get higher wages? Then thats a discussion between you and your boss you can also voluntary join a labour union in order to support your cause. If you feel that sounds too complicated then get a better job.
 ,Short answer: we have to keep false productivity high so that we can tax it and keep our currency valuable.The long answer involves an analysis of demand-side economics and Keynesianism but begins with the fact that we have set up an economy based on borrowing money which requires that we generate constant growth which requires that we constantly expand so that our tax base expands so that we can continue paying entitlements so that the proles buy lots of stuff so that we have constant growth which drives economic expansion and therefore makes our money a "good buy" so we can keep borrowing. It is a circular Ponzi scheme that conservatives warned against years ago.
 ,My wage hasnt been stagnant so I keep on working.  I cant answer for others.
 ,First of all the burden of proof is on the person asserting the theory so we need studies proving that climate change is indeed real without fudged data or imprecise models.I hit the search engines to see what I could find:* https://nicholas.duke.edu/about/news/global-warming-more-moderate-worst-case-models* https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/environment/global-warming-is-rubbish-says-top-professor-1-6536732* https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11561629/Top-scientists-start-to-examine-fiddled-global-warming-figures.html* https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/trends-in-extreme-weather-events-since-1900--an-enduring-conundrum-for-wise-policy-advice-2167-0587-1000155.pdf* http://file.scirp.org/Html/7-2801173_63199.htm* http://www.tech-know-group.com/papers/Reassessing_CO2_climate_role.pdf* http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.04.045* http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11191-013-9647-9* https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2013/07/refuting-the-myths-of-climate-change/* https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007JD008746I would recommend starting with Michael Crichton's magnificent *State of Fear* since all of the arguments and counter-arguments are discussed there.
 ,> I'm a very strong believer that looking for "impartiality" in science is a fool's errandYou're correct. It is no more science unfortunately. There are plenty of 'adulterated' results in several areas of science and/or an effort to completely ignore/explain away actual facts because they demonstrate something we'd rather not believe.In the event of a result we don't like from a social perspective it is typical behavior to blame the design of the study or sometimes to attribute results to some kind of "boogie man" like the idea that language is a construct of the patriarchy and/or white male oppression etc.In terms of whether some study will be forthcoming: where's the profit in it? I don't mean that entirely cynically but who will be made better off through a fact-finding mission? I'm not making a statement as to the veracity of climate change but if it's false then who actually cares that it's false? That would seem an inconsequential finding.As to scientific consistency the original numbers and studies are well known to be flawed even by the original purveyors of climate change. I've been to one of the foundational scientists' homes and chatted with him for about a half-an-hour and he's entirely sold-out on the idea; dude owns a couple of identical Prius' and his whole house is covered in solar panels along with some of his yard. A couple of his other high profile colleagues believe in climate change but in a more broad sense; as in ice ages and warming periods have happened throughout the history of the world but they fully reject the current hysteria surrounding climate studies because the underlying data is well-known to be highly adulterated and inconsistent in its methodology (going back to the "hockey stick theory" and the work of the first person mentioned). Now neither of them will say anything except in very hushed tones because they know that the result of speaking out would be their professional reputations and in the same way that speaking out about a new doctrine in religion is likely to get one counted a heretic with an ensuing rush to anathematize the practitioner that they would face the same backlash by those that profit from climate change.
 ,Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. It doesn’t even come close to the heat retention capability of water vapor which is a significantly more abundant atmospheric gas than CO2.The entire CO2-induced global warming/climate change alarmist narrative is based on the assertion that the Earth’s atmosphere has increased from 0.03% CO2 to 0.04% CO2 over the past ~150 years. It’s worth noting that that’s orders of magnitude lower than the concentration of atmospheric water vapor but I digress.A fundamental principle of the scientific method is that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation. Is there a way to prove that the increase in CO2 is solely due to human activity? And what about that 150+ year old data? Is it completely reliable? Were the testing methods/instrumentation used back in the 1800s the same as what’s used now? Of course not.And how can it be proven that 0.04% [CO2] is a catastrophic increase from 0.03% [CO2] in the first place? Furthermore as previously stated the correlation between human CO2 emissions and [atmospheric CO2] is NOT necessarily an indicator of causation.And what about the reliability of historical temperature data? How was it collected? Wouldn’t the statistical margin of error be significant when it comes to examining and collecting data that’s over a century old? I find it very hard to believe that the margin of error would be less than 1 or 2 degrees celsius at a minimum.Then of course we’ve seen every single recent prediction of an impending climate catastrophe be proven to be dead wrong time and again. The seas have consistently risen ~2mm per year for the past few decades yet we’re told by “scientists” that the seas will eventually rise several feet over the next century and decimate coastal areas. There’s just no evidence whatsoever that proves those predictions to be reliable. The only thing that seems to change is that the climate apocalypse keeps getting pushed further and further into the future. It’s always coming soon but it never seems to actually get here.The whole thing really seems like a farce to me. Flooding? Must be climate change. Drought? Climate change. Arctic ice shrinking? Climate change. Arctic ice growing? Climate change. Wildfires in California? Climate change. Mild winter? Climate change. Cold winter? Climate change. Repeat ad nauseam. And it’s all because humans possibly had a role in increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration from 0.03% to 0.04% over the past 150 years?

 ,I prefer completely private education. Public schooling is expensive and worthless being both low quality and high in propaganda.With private education some people would "fall through the cracks." That too is natural selection.
 ,I would prefer completely private. The issue here is that with a public system the disparity between wearily education and poor education is smaller. So with a private system everyone will learn more but they might not be as competitive with people at the nicer schools. I think it’s worth it.
 ,I'm in support of a mix for the reasons already stated. Public education lessens the disparity between rich and poor but is also beholden to the goals of the government (which is less about actual education and more about conformity respect for governmental authority propagandizing the youth and never questioning anything you're told).Both systems have a different set of problems. Both systems have a different set of benefits. So I support a mix of the two.
 ,There is an important benefit in compulsory education as it means no clueless illiterate adults whose only crime was being born to terrible parents. There's also an important benefit in state funded education and state run schools. They provide a guaranteed baseline of education and parents can supplement as they see fit. However what I think the ideal should be is something like a system where the government just declares that a school will get $10000 for every child it educates for that year. So you just tie a kid's social to 10k for their education. If just that were to happen you'd have a bunch of schools pop up who found a way to run at a profit on 10k a head. And then they'll have to compete with each other they'll have to start fighting for the best teachers they'll have to start fencing and robotics clubs get into athletics endear themselves to the community. It's in their interest to appeal to the parents so they don't move their kids and lose thousands by the head. And under this system parents could have a shot at getting their kids into more elite and expensive schools a parent that can't afford 20k a child to send their kid to a highly ranked private school might be able to pay 10k a child if the government is subsidizing the other 10.The point being is that like Healthcare if you give government almost exclusive power to provide something vital then you get trapped by having to deal with their inefficiencies politics lies and corruptions. And they have no real incentive to appease you because they hold the mastercard over you since you have no alternatives and are so dependent that just the threat of dismantling it sends you frothing.
 ,I’m fine with a public option for those who are truly poor with the majority of us in private healthcare.   That makes infinitely more sense then destroying a system that works well for most of us to help a small percentage who always had access to required healthcare anyway.
 ,I have no problem with certain things existing in a public space. The private sector is driven by money and nobody will see a profit running 100 miles of electrical infrastructure just to hit five farmhouses in the middle of nowheresville nebraska.Education is the same way. The private sector will gravitate towards where the most customers are leaving those who already have poor access to education with little recourse. It would further increase the divide between the "haves" and the "have nots" allowing the wealthy to pursue higher education and leaving the not-so-wealthy as an illiterate underclass.Contrary to popular belief most conservatives want to provide the lower classes with all the opportunity they need to advance to a higher class.
 ,I'm about as conservative as it gets with economic issues yet I still support free basic education as it is transformative for a society as a whole.  I also support land grant  universities as established by the Morrill Acts.  These laws enhance society through comparatively inexpensive dissemination of knowledge in the fields of agriculture the sciences and engineering.Ultimately conservatism must be practiced with underlying compassion intent on bettering overall human status.   Conservatism is so successful in practice is because of it is consistent with human nature.  This is not a concept that is quick to grasp.   Arguments against conservatism are emotional appeals whose roots grow out of  selfishness.  "If he has more than me I should have the right to steal."  It is easy for an emotional and foolish person to mistake conservatism for greed.
 ,There are some public schools that are decent - because the community itself is decent not purely because it's a public school.Having said that I believe families who wish to homeschool or use a private school should legally have as free of a hand as possible to utilize either of those options.
 ,Sure I've come across racist people. They don't all fit in a certain mold though. I've met racists on the right and left of all races and of all beliefs. Not a single one would identify as a racist. It's rare to find such folks though.
 ,Absolutely and fully racists do identify as racists.  It is usually the whole point of a racist group.  There are however many people who are not racists who carry a cultural bag or two that your typical SJW (also cultural baggage) would loathe and scorn.
 ,>There seems to always be explanations for why someone of another race is hated based on it being about heritage levels of assimilation culture prefering to be with their own kind of people....Of all the people who *might* accurately be called racists the number who actually "hate" is very small.  Preference for one's race does not necessarily result in animosity and the negative actions towards the affected group are often exaggerated.On a national level a good example is Japan.  No doubt the Japanese have a superior attitude of their culture.  They strictly limit immigration.But they allow tourists from all over the world to visit their country; they travel worldwide generally being amiable and polite to people they meet.  Preference for one's culture one's people should hardly be equated with hatred of other groups.
 ,Personally I am against all federal tax credits whether they apply to corporations or individuals. I'm also against so called loopholes.  I think tax rates should be low for everyone. I am against taxes being so complicated that specialists must be paid or hired to do them. Complicated tax laws increase bureaucracy. Bureaucracy costs money. I'm against needless bureaucracy. With very few exceptions no entity in the US should pay zero tax. That includes individuals as well.
 ,Yes my issue is I would like to get the same tax rate.
 ,This is an "issue" only for those who do not file taxes.If you generate enough deductions you will pay zero in tax.The question then is whether those deductions are legitimate.Generally the television and Reddit audience are people who have never done taxes for a business so this is all voodoo to them.
 ,A lot of people look at the word "corporation" and think of some massive faceless almost *evil* entity bent on pure profit and screwing the poor and middle class to enrich a wealthy few.Corporations are at their core still *people*. And they employ often *thousands* of people. And those people (you would hope) are paid well and go on to pay some amount of income tax. The more profits a company can keep the more successful they are and the more *people* they can employ and pay well.Yes many corporations pay dividends to stock holders but of course they should. Those stock holders are *people* who fronted some of the money for these companies to stay in business. They deserve to be rewarded for their success. How do you think all of our 401(k) plans work? Most of them grow off the dividends and growth of successful corporations.Corporations don't exist to fund the government largess they exist to make money and hopefully employ a lot of people. In the same way the government doesn't exist to steal from the rich and give to the poor in an attempt to redistribute wealth and make things "fair". Why should I care if a company takes legal means to maximize its profits? Why should I care if its *people* and shareholders are successful?
 ,That's a nuanced question as far as I'm concerned. If the corporation doesn't end up paying through other avenues then I see a problem. Other than the idea that there is very little in revenue and/or very high expenses and no employees I can't see too many plausible explanations.I think more holistically on the matter much like they do in some other countries. In the U.S. we're mainly motivated by profit. In other countries their culture is more of a paternal role for one's workplace which provides benefits and exists for the benefit not only for the owners but for the employees.So that sets up my actual response: Part of what a company does is empower OTHERS to pay taxes. In other words if you pay wages to a worker then you're giving them a productive opportunity and hopefully keeping them off of the tax benefits teet which they will in turn spend causing more taxes to be collected on the money (at least for the State no VAT yet). One may argue that the payroll taxes paid by the corporation is legitimately only a reduction in the pay rate of the end worker who would otherwise be awarded a higher rate of pay if not for taxes. At least in the running of my business that was true. We had our taxes increase substantially which cut into yearly increases a few years ago. It just ended up that the State took more of the cash I was going to give them. The State Treasury won and the workers lost (or didn't win nearly as much as I had planned).So in consideration of the above corporations create taxation in most cases it just might not be a direct payment.I am almost of the mind that we should either just tax businesses alone and ignore individual taxation or else perhaps make businesses closer to tax-free and tax individuals. Every time a dollar moves it gets taxed into oblivion by the government so what does it actually matter?Earn $1 on a W-2: Pay FICA tax and Income Tax. Spend what's left pay Sales Tax. Put it in an interest-bearing investment tax the return on it while inflating it/debasing the purchasing power. Invest it in a LT holding and hopefully defer or eliminate taxation. Put it in a passive investment (like real estate) and dodge almost all taxation.It's a silly game. I think taxes are generally just a wedge issue to infuriate people but of course the anger is entirely misdirected. If anything the fury should be at the federal government for intentionally creating a very distorted game where they centrally plan who wins and who loses. It really shouldn't be done that way.
 ,I have no problem with this whatsoever. Tax deductions are an incentive for companies to practice behaviors that are positive for society which is why we make them available. It's more valuable to our economy and therefore our nation to have companies paying large salaries providing health insurance paying tuition assistance contributing to retirement accounts and offering sick leave than the tax we'd receive on those dollars would be worth so we allow companies to deduct those expenses from their tax liability. There's no limit on the amount of those high-value things we like them doing so if a company does enough good to reduce their tax liability to $0 I'm perfectly fine with that.
 ,Well what you call loopholes are actually just the law. They're not doing something sneaky they're looking at the law and complying with it. It's also literally the stated mission of the IRS to have each taxpayer pay the absolute minimum that they're obligated to in taxes and if they find errors in your favor they even take it upon themselves to correct it for you and send you the windfall. So it's not like they're playing a game.Also although there's way more to the story than they're simply getting to operate for free (they're not) let's pretend exactly that was the case. And let's say I'm the owner of a billion dollar company that didn't have income taxes. No matter what that billion dollars is getting taxed somewhere. The huge payroll of the huge staff I need to employ to get to billions? They're paid with company money and their wages are taxed therefore that's one way my companies funds end up in the US treasury. If we make products then no matter what those products are taxed at the state and national level therefore my companies outputs are taxed. If we own the building we operate out of then we're on the hook for property taxes no matter what if we rent then we're vicariously paying the property tax for the lessor. There's a ton of ways for taxes to sneak in there besides just the federal income tax so it's not like these corporations are just taking the government for a ride.
 ,The news article is reporting on this study https://itep.org/notadime/ which specifies the tax breaks used. * Accelerated Depreciation - used to encourage capital investment* Stock Options - employee compensation (who report this as taxable income)* Fossil Fuel Tax Subsidies - Used to encourage domestic energy production* Alternative Energy Tax Subsidies - Used to encourage green energy* Depletion - Deduct the reduction in value of land due to extracting natural resources.* Research and Development (R&D) credit* low-income housing creditMost of these items are used to encourage long-term growth and/or encourage political goals (or aren't really tax loopholes). These types of tax avoidance strategies are more palatable then using tax shelters as at least they are keeping the money and spending in the US.
 ,Corporation (noun) A body formed and authorized by law to act as a single person.The owners of corporations are people.  Those people pay lots and lots of taxes much of it on income derived from partial ownership of the corporation.  If you would bother to look you will see that about half of everything US citizens pay is a form of tax.  If the corporation pays less tax the owners of the corporation make more and thus pay more in personal taxes.  Lower corporate taxes create more overall revenue to the government.  It also lessens the handicap US corporations have in a world where corporate taxes on average are lower than they are in the US.We might find common ground on eliminating tax loopholes.
 ,Legalization of marijuana is probably the one where I wholeheartedly agree with progressives.
 ,There's several that I agree with. While I don't love the 'Green New Deal' because I believe the reforms are outlandish I am very much in favor of reducing our carbon footprint. Recycling renewable energy and eco-friendly consumer packaging need to become higher priorities. I also agree with the nationwide legalization of marijuana.
 ,[removed]
 ,The cost of healthcare is ridiculous.But not an inch further.
 ,I find a lot of common ground with progressives on Environmental issues and Education.The Environment is our most important resource and it's crucial that we strive to protect and preserve it by reducing pollution finding better alternative energy sources cutting down on our energy consumption etc.Education is another big issue for me. I agree that our educational system in the United States is broken and in desperate need of reform. I personally like the idea of a Common Core curriculum and I also think that more Humanities should be reintroduced to the curriculum.
 ,[removed]
 ,I can say that I agree with Democrats on a number of issues. However I don't find any agreement with Progressives on any issues that I can think of off the top of my head.
 ,Corporate welfare decriminalization of marijuana civil liberties in Police-citizen interactions.
 ,With progressives I agree on the basic premise: society should move forward.However that is the opposite of what Progressives nowadays do. They sit around looking backward trying to invent enough guilt so that they have an excuse to divide up the wealth of the past.Progressives after all brought us programs like eugenics or the idea that we should encourage healthy breeding. They originally were in favor of subsidizing exploration adventure and sane normal living so that our civilization could become more advanced although this was in a Nietzschean sense and not a Marxist one.I would say that I am a Nietzschean Progressive. I think we are here to do more than eat and shop and anyone who does not have three-quarters of his time to himself is a slave. I think we need to leave as close to zero impact on the environment as possible and this means that not everyone can do or own everything that they want. I believe we need to explore the stars but agree with Ray Bradbury that what is holding us back is our disorganization and moral confusion within. The frontier is us in other words.I do not have a problem with eugenics. If you want to abort the retarded gas the insane and sterilize the criminals this strikes me as forward-moving. We either accept natural selection or our ignorance of it destroys us. On the other hand as a Progressive I could never support the subsidy state since it works against natural selection. Flat taxes no welfare and no entitlements all the way.I think we should allow people more flexibility with what they do to their bodies not so much from a "muh freedom" point of view but one of progress. Let us see how everything turns out. Without us supporting their healthcare they can take any drugs they want medical or illegal and purchase any operations they want. You can be a transgender steroid abuser on LSD and heroin in my world but no one is obligated to help you if your liver launches itself into the street or you have no retirement fund. Welcome to freedom; it comes with natural selection and sometimes you are what is being selected out.I find the "Green New Deal" to be far too limited. In my view we would simply set aside half of all land for nature and keep humans off of it. We could license and indemnify snipers to enforce this; if you are seen in the green belt the only thing you can expect is a 7.62x39 winging itself through your vitals. It also makes zero sense to pay foreign aid to or interact with the third world since its population explosion threatens all of nature.At the same time I know that this Progressive attitude benefits conservatives. Our methods are heading in the same place and work better. We make healthy families and those make healthy families and those genes persist while the flaky Leftist lifestyle leads to ruined families and neurotic children. If we implemented full Progressivism in a few centuries you would have nothing but actual conservatives.
 ,I agree with most just not their methods of correcting the problem. Such as prison reform I agree that for profit prisons are terrible and we have penalties for non violent crimes that are more harsh than violent ones and that is a problem. I don't believe we can get anywhere near a solution to this by vilifying law enforcement and making excuses for criminals.
 ,Legalization og Drugs and universal healthcare.

 ,Do we not value the 4th amendment anymore?
 ,>Then again people driving around drugged or drunk seem to do a lot of damage so how should we stop that?Culturally. At one point in time it was okay to drive drunk and we turned the page on that era time for us to do the same about driving impaired. On that same hand if the guy refused a breathalyzer he would potentially lose his license for up to a year so why can't we do the same thing with the method to detect other drugs?
 ,Woah hold up. There's a lot going on here and it's way different from the kneejerk reaction your quote implies.> It was about 6:30 on a Friday night in January when Phoenix Police Det. Kemp Layden pulled over a white Jeep Cherokee that was speeding and weaving in and out of its lane.Failure to maintain control of your vehicle is a **gosh darned** good reason for an officer to pull you over.> The 47-year-old driver spoke slowly his eyes were red and watery and his pupils were dilated. The inside of the Jeep reeked of marijuana and the driver failed a field sobriety test which includes walking heel-to-toe and standing on one leg.Again. All of this gives *ample* evidence that this driver is impared and coupled with driving erratically is a threat to others on the road.> He told the officer he had smoked marijuana a few hours earlier and taken a prescription sedative the night before police say.And he admits to being impared on drugs that require a blood test for confirmation.Yes in this instance he's done for and has lost his 4th amendement right. Nobody could claim this to be unreasonable.And as long as the roadside bloodtests are used in these types of circumstances it's not an issue. But at some point someone is going to get the bright idea to use one at a dui checkpoint.
 ,I have no issue with this. If you're going to break the law you need to be prepared for the consequences of such.
 ,They should be permitted to live here yes.
 ,Yes absolutely. Nothing about having views and opinions that are objectively wrong and have failed on numerous occasions should keep you out of the country.However the question becomes why are you coming to a capitalist society if you believe communism and/or socialism is more ideal? Especially when there are strong commun-ish and social-ish societies you could relocate to like western europe or china? I have to assume anyone doing that is coming here with an intent to effect change away from capitalism and towards socialism and communism.In that case uf they choose to come here and change heargs and minds with honest factual discussion then more power to them. If they intend to come here to spread misinformation and dissent I would label them as a foreign operative and bar their access.Your ideas can be whatever they want. But we're gonna hold you accountable for your actions.

FBI has lots of stats.
 ,I consider myself Pro-citizen rights. In some situations it does mean being anti-cop. I’m alright with that. In some situations it means the blame is squarely on the citizen where it belongs. In general I am never in a support of government power over reach or abuse.
 ,Police are necessary to maintain law and order in society. They are in place to uphold the law protect the general public and arrest those who break the law. Their role is directly related to public safety and the general welfare of the public.That's not to say that they do this perfectly 100% of the time. It's already been said but police officers are human beings who often make mistakes and bad judgements. However that is no justification for abuse of power police brutality etc. Body cameras were a really good idea and they aid to protect officers who are falsely accused and condemn officers who are guilty. I think more effort should be put into finding more ideas like this. One thing it presents us with is facts. If we can see and hear a situation that an officer is involved in then it gives us a better idea of what happened.I think it's important to also put ourselves in the police officer's shoes. I've seen some videos like [this one](https://www.policeone.com/use-of-force/articles/8097484-Video-Anti-police-protester-undergoes-use-of-force-scenario-training/) that put people into police scenarios. Most of them that I've seen seem to lead to building more empathy for police officers. It's easy to be critical of others until we are faced with the same decision. We never really know what we would do until we are put into that situation.

 ,The police who do bad things are a fraction of all police. One should be pro-cop because they are not really appreciated for what they do. Also most crimes going unsolved is just natural. People are going to get away with crimes.
 ,You shouldn’t. I think “pro-cop” and “BLM” is all just divisive ways of bringing light to the sad cases that happen on both sides. It’s best to get all the facts in the case then decide. Right now that’s not happening. There’s a post now with like 40K upvotes about a cop shooting a black guy in a Burger King. It faild to mention the guy had just pointed his gun at people and received two seperate 911 calls.
 ,2 reasons: They work to protect order. Order is good because we all live together. And they are people too people doing a tough job. It’s possible to both love and appreciate the police and detest bad actors. But if people only hear the latter they stop believing the former exists.
 ,You shouldn't.  Justice should be blind.  If anything the cops should be held to a higher standard than ordinary citizens.
 ,> Most crimes go unsolvedThis one is easy: without a total surveillance state you depend on citizens for information vital to solving crimes. If no one cares cops can poke around but unless they find clear forensics pointing to someone already known to them they are just going to catalogue evidence and file it.> Most police are doing nothing to call out and change the system which allows for police who use excessive force to get off easy without any jail timeIs the system really in need of change? Do we want to be jailing police based on accusations? The real damage is to their careers. That will regulate those who can be regulated and the right thing to do with the others is to un-badge them as quickly as possible.> Many “good” police are standing up and defending police who use excessive force in courtThe blue line has always been there. Then again when you attack "the cops" you create it.> Police shootings and brutalityI have seen a few excesses but these mostly relate to individuals. No department-wide policies. Our police departments are both under-funded and bloated because we use them for political ends such as affirmative action and paperwork to obscure certain failed policies. Fix that and redirect the money toward mentorship programs and you can filter out the crazies early on.As far as are conservatives pro-cop or anti-cop there is nothing in [our canon](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/introductory_reading) that suggests we take a position there. We are not fond of the state because we recognize that it is just a large corporation and is self-interested like the rest. We respect law and order however.
 ,My point has already been made.  The overwhelming number of body-cam videos support the cop and incriminate the perps.  After watching hours of these things you have much much greater respect for the cops.  I want the cops in my town to be as safe as possible and support them fully.The one time I ran into bad cops was in NYC at the US Tennis Open.  The cops near the event were being paid by pro scalpers to arrest anyone else trying to scalp tickets.  I so wish they all got caught.
 ,Because they're doing a job.  They're not your cartoon.
 ,In my opinion one should never be pro cop. That's not the same thing as saying hate the human being whose in the uniform. But the police should invoke the same apprehension as an irs agent we acknowledge they're necessary and can and often do complete good and Thankless work. However they don't deserve veneration as they're ultimately an arm of the state in the police case a militant violent arm that has some discretion of whether to enter any citizen into the criminal justice system and depending on jurisdiction can outright exectue someone citing extremely flimsy self defense arguments that would never pass for a citizen who didn't happen to be in that occupation. The way I look at it a cop showing up can literally never improve my life unless I'm being attacked or having something returned to me so if the best case scenario is you leave me exactly how you found me I'd rather not interact with you.
 ,Because as long as you're not breaking the law you're pretty much safe.  I'm sure there is a small % of dirty cops who do scummy things but there's nothing to be done about it. The idea that all police officers are these god like mortals who only do good is ridiculous.  They're human too. But 99.9 % of police officers are good people. Who are putting themselves at risk for your safety and they deserve your respect for doing so.  Do dont break the law show them respect and you should be fine.

 ,Absolutely.Marriage as we know it is a christian institution. And christianity isn't so big on the whole gay thing.The flip side to this is that there's no reason two people in a long term commited homosexual relationship shouldn't enjoy all the benefits (and downsides) that a straight couple would enjoy.You might not remember the whole "don't call it marriage" thing. That's where it comes from having the secular government take over a christian institution for something that is directly against christian values. It would be like... It would be like providing food stamps to everyone that covers double value for all pork products. Technically it's equal but Muslims might have something to say about it.
 ,That depends upon the "type of Conservative."Same-Sex Marriage wasn't actually an issue until about the turn of the Century. It became an issue because Karl Rove decided that it would become a wedge issue that would whip up the Conservative base and get voter turnout to propel George W. Bush to victory.While Karl Rove was right and it was highly effective for voter turnout--Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) items appeared all over the ballots in that era.The natural fallout is that Karl Rove accelerated the time-table for the legalization of Same Sex Marriage as all it took to make Same Sex Marriage legal was the overturning of such a law. Previous to that it would have been decades of a very hard push to ever get SSM legalized and would likely have been fought state-by-state with a potential for a victory under the 14th Amendment via the tax code (Why should one homosexual marriage and tax credit be honored in MA when the same is not afforded a homosexual marriage tax credit in GA?)There are fairly serious issues for the gay community in that they couldn't make medical decisions or end-of-life decisions for their partners they didn't have inheritance rights etc. And along those end-of-life decisions they also weren't really permitted in medical crisis situations. Sure they could be appointed in some fashion whether as a Power-of-Attorney or what have you but it wasn't exactly fair to the gay community to not be recognized.I think my own faith journey informs me that I'm unconcerned with SSM as a topic. I personally support it for the above reasons.In addition I find no strength in the argument that "God defined marriage as being between a man and a woman." If one believes in the utmost authority of God as arbiter in marriage then marriage is not redefined because man corrupts it.What concerns me about the SSM issue and has always been my concern? Adoptions. We won't really know what the effects are for quite some time. Invariably there will be children paraded around by the right in which some children will be suicidal and it will be attached to them being raised by homosexual parents. And there will be children paraded around by the left saying that they were raised and became immensely successful because they were raised by homosexual parents. Neither will actually be accurate or trusthworthy but they'll be accepted by each respective camp as proof positive that their views and beliefs on the matter are accurate.In any case SSM is not going to be overturned or overruled at this point. It's the law and it absolutely won't change back anymore than other major civil rights decisions will be overturned--we won't be overturning Loving v Virginia nor Brown v The Board of Education etc. Those are very decided case law and not up for debate.In any case I think a lot of the question hinges on your age group and where you live e.g. demographics.
 ,"Gay marriage" is a media creation designed to force the Leftist agenda on the rest of us. There is no reason for marriage as a homosexual nor does it benefit them. The whole thing is a talking point.The Right realizes that in order to fight this one it must first fight the Left and win.No one can be actually conservative -- conserving the best of our past -- and support gay marriage. By the same token our oldest literature demonstrates tolerance of gay relationships and the recognition that gay people are different but can be accepted as such.This really is not rocket science except for Redditors who seem to be the minimum wage labor of the internet.
 ,of politics? Probbly notof opinion? YOu'd be surprised ( or not) to find out how many conservatives disagree about gay "marriage"" Was the biggest argument against gay marriage always religiously based? "     For some  people. For others like me it has always been about considering equal a group of people whose sexuality - and too often  identity- revolves around having sex in a hole designed by nature to produce store and expel feces with the associated health risks  implied.
 ,Why would that have changed?
 ,The argument against gay marriage is that it goes against the foundation of western civilization the family.  Two men cannot have a baby - it doesn't biologically work.  Two women cannot have a baby - it doesn't biologically work.So if you're asking whether acceptance of homosexuality is a conservative principle it most certainly isn't.  If you're asking whether American conservatives are abandoning the fight because it's a losing cause against the depraved American liberal you'd be accurate.
 ,We should DO the same thing to her that we did to Obama (if you want your doctor you can keep your doctor) and Bill (I did not have relations with that woman) and Former Attorney General Eric Holder and all of the other prior administrations staff who have clearly lied (some to congress).  Since she was not under oath - we should DO absolutely nothing.  You can change how you FEEL about her if you want - that is personal preference.
 ,None it’s just another public persecution by the Pharisaical left. People on both the left and right say dumb things that aren’t true. It’s called politics.  Let’s focus on real issues instead of punishing the Press Secretary for doing what Press Secretaries do: over-embellishing something to lessen the blow to the President. Her entire job is to soften the impact of the President’s actions by saying things like this to the Press. That’s her job that has always been the job description no matter who sits in the Oval Office.
 ,Who cares? She's a Press Secretary. Should she be punished any more than numerous actual news outlets that peddled a completely false and embellished narrative for the past few years?Should some members of Congress be censured for peddling high profile lies?I think it's time to move on. Isn't the U.S. humiliated enough by the Third Red Scare by now?
 ,I mean that's actually true though.  There were lots of FBI agents upset with Comey.
 ,No. Everyone lies is literally so pervasive in the political class its a trope. Even politifact concedes that against people it idolizes. If she had lied to the investigators that'd be one thing but for better or more likely worse the way the American system is right now it's better to lie to the American people on lie TV as long as you're honest with federal investigators behind closed doors.
 ,I suggest always lying to the press in the same way people should never talk to the police without an attorney present.The press has no interest in truth. Nor does it have your best interests at heart. They make money by making drama. The more you suffer the more they get paid.For this reason you should tell them things that confound them and require them to do investigative work to unravel. They will not do it because we replaced a small army of educated honest people with lots of low-paid millennial propaganda monkeys formed into a press cadre. Those people not only do not care about the truth but need to force it into a certain narrative in order to justify their mostly failed lives.For this reason you should always lie to the press because whatever you tell them they will twist into a lie.
 ,Two different thoughts here. Firstly a press briefing is simply a meeting. Anyone can say anything and there are no real repercussions from it. If you think the press secretary of any administration is telling the truth 100% of the time then you're a fool. I don't have any issue with her words and I don't find a need for anything further.Secondly Sanders admitted she lied during a Press Brief. The Democrats have lied to the American people for two straight years and have manipulated the media and misled Americans to create a certain view. I don't see them admitting anything and I don't see anyone calling for mass resignations in the Democrat party. Therefore I don't see any need at all to apply some weird double standard on Huckabee-Sanders. The Democrats are trying to distract.
 ,That is not a lie.  There are lots of honest FBI agents who are biting at the bit to get the truth out.  We should thank Ms. Sanders for her showing integrity and honesty.
 ,I'll start by saying that there a several brands of conservatives. I can only speak for my own viewpoint which is libertarian-leaning. There are certainly other conservatives and Republicans more broadly that hold different views.&#x200B;I think you may misunderstand why many of us want (some) drugs and prostitution to remain illegal. In the case of drugs I want drug use among minors and ***highly addictive*** substances banned. I couldn't care less if a consenting adult wants to smoke pot (not in public to prevent unwanted second hand exposure) or do LSD. Heroin however immediately robs individuals of their capacity for reason. Notice that this argument has nothing to do with a religious/ moral code outside the belief that we should protect individual liberty and rationality.&#x200B;The case of prostitution is a little more complicated. It is more a protection for the poor and powerless. One has to ask: if prostitution is okay and is something we want in society then why is Harvey Weinstein a bad guy? He exchanged job opportunities for sex. Is that really different than exchanging money for sex? It seems to me that if we as a society want to exclude Weinstein's actions then we cannot allow prostitution. Furthermore while there are certainly some women who would willingly and enthusiastically partake in sex work I find it highly likely that poor women will feel forced into it. Plus all the problems with sex trafficking. &#x200B;I'm sorry if this is a bit of a ramble. I am at work and don't have tons of time to spend here. Please respond if you have questions.
 ,Different strains of conservatism are going to see these differently.I think some drugs should be legal and we should only punish other illegal behavior if that results from it. People who can be responsible with their high aren't the problem the law needs to be concerned with and people who start fights or steal under the influence can get sent to jail. There are ways to discourage drugs without arresting people just for using a little bit. Honest educational programs through the normal school curriculum encouraging recovery and drug abstinence support groups taxing products. Same thing with prostitution. It's disgusting. It also doesn't hurt anyone except the people who choose to be involved. And maybe the client's spouse but it's no different than him having an unpaid one-night stand which is currently legal. Trafficking and forced prostitution which is a form of rape are not the same thing as "ordinary" prostitution and *those* are what the law needs to focus on. I've written about this a bit before in summary that decriminalization gets us more of what we want and can actually achieve - keeping minors out of the business finding trafficking victims punishing abusive clients. You won't get rid of the oldest profession unfortunately but you can help people get out by not slamming them with criminal charges fines and jail time that make it hard to get a different job. And making it safer for victims to contact police.So in both cases legalization/decrim is a direction I support with some distaste. We can waste time and money going after casual drug users or we can focus on punishing people who hurt others. We can throw adults who willingly exchange sex for cash in jail or we can pursue rapists and traffickers while leaving peaceful adults alone. Bonus: more of them will pay income tax like the rest of us do.Morality isn't what government is for. Government is to protect essential rights and people have the right to be as immoral as they please - as long as they're not infringing on someone *else's* rights. And we have the right to tell them they can't do that on our property and we won't participate. Where the conservative part comes in is that we all need the right to opt out; that we can teach our children that immoral behavior is not okay and we can choose not to associate with those scenes.
 ,Just going to say that I don't care about the behaviors related to substance use (abuse?) or prostitution but about the externalities.Substance use: Might be fine. Some drink alcohol with no problem. For others it destroys their entire life makes them unemployable may lead to drunk driving deaths of someone that wasn't explicitly making the choice to be endangered by it apart from taking the common roadways. Would it be better if substances were legal and regulated? I don't know. We have some less than admirable results in areas around the world where drug use is legalized.Prostitution. More concerned about the spread of disease from that. I can't imagine that prostitutes don't contract some nasty bugs here and there from their partners. I don't have any statistics on it but that's always been my "skin crawling" thought when prostitution is mentioned. I'm not sure what virtues legal prostitution would provide to our society. Should it be legal? I'll also give that an 'I don't know.'I realize I didn't precisely answer your question but hopefully it might engage some thought.
 ,We conserve the best of civilization. Anything else is a means to that end and we value ends over means.Since we exist in a strong state and since it regulates everything in our lives we have two choices:1. Undo all of that regulation. No EPA no FDA no DOE no entitlements.2. Regulate all destructive things instead of just those that Leftists dislike.As long as we are paying for healthcare we can regulate what goes into people's bodies.As long as we have to deal with the fallout of broken families dead hookers broken lives etc. we can ban prostitution.Both of these are good ideas.My cynical natural selection viewpoint is to pay for nothing and legalize everything then let natural selection do her work. I.e. if you step over a prostitute dying on the street from being stabbed by a serial killer the correct response is to laugh.
 ,Backwards.Ideally everything is 18 including alcohol (but that's a tricky sort-of-state issue). Failing that raise the age of majority for everything to 21 that you can possibly raise to it and openly admit what you're doing.It's like they can't quite stomach the idea of treating young adults like young adults responsible for their own decisions so they do this weird patronizing "this is for your own good" baloney while they restrict their rights. Let adults be adults or be honest and go the whole way. "The age of majority is now 21. If you are 20 or under you're a minor. No tobacco no alcohol no taking out loans in your own name or signing contracts no porn."Alternate idea - quit freaking out about vaping and just enforce the 18+ only laws we already have. It's powerful harm reduction vs. smoking and a few extra people picking up the habit still means a lot less public health danger.
 ,My guess is this is a calculated move.  The dems are proposing lowering the voting age to 16.  But dems also really like controlling people when it comes to making decisions dems think are bad for you.  So and this is just my guess Mitch gets them on the record voting in favor of raising the smoking age then he can say "what?  you think an 18 year-old can't even make his own decision to smoke but we should let 16 year-olds vote?"In other words I don't think this really has anything to do with the policy itself I think it's (kind of clever) political gamesmanship.
 ,we need 1 age that qualifies you as an adult. once you reach that age you are afforded all of you rights and responsibilities as an adult american citizen. this includes voting purchasing whatever you want to purchase providing its legal to purchase for the rest of the citizenry being drafted for military service everything. making a poor decision like smoking shouldn't be micromanaged by the government. people should be free to make their own decision in life once they are legally an adult. &#x200B;raising the purchasing age to 21 wont stop underage kids from smoking any more than the 18 purchase age did. most likely it will just force 18-20 year olds to figure out a way to get smokes illegally.
 ,Ut's stupid because a person is legally considered an adult at 18 not at 21. They can due for their country in a war  get married vote. Legally they are full adults they do not have to wait til they turn 21 to be adults. Also it should not be up to politicians to legally dictate adult behavior and you can't legally legislate morality anyway if someone is going to do whatever legal age or not they are going to find a way to do it. Age is not the arbiter of morality or maturity at all. It is stupid that somebody can be killed in wars but can't legally smoke a cigarette or drink a beer based on their age and it was determined by people who technically are old  like McConnell who is not exactly a spring chicken himself at all.
 ,Why is government involved in regulating the ages of consumption anyway? Bring back freedom/responsibility instead of management/obedience.Even more we only have vaping because of the massive crackdown on cigarettes and we only have that because of the crackdown on pipe and cigar smoking in offices. Hitler knew how bad cigarettes were but found that total tobacco bans were massively unpopular; the West achieved much more of a change but has done so by driving people to other options like vaping weed drinking drugs etc.
 ,  I think this is backwards. If you can fight and die for your country then you can smoke a cigarette dip vape take out a loan or move out of your parents home. And I think you should be able to drink as well alas that's another discussion. I think it all ties into together though personally. And I do not think that the country that would hand you a weapon and let you come home in a flag draped coffin should limit your "adultness".   I believe it is a complete moronic idea to think someone is capable of handling war but cannot handle tobacco OR alcohol. You are either an adult or not. I really wish our government would stop sending people to war but STILL tell them they are too immature to understand the consequences of their actions when it comes to substances. This is utterly ridiculous to me.
 ,It won't mean anything its incredibly easy to get a vape under 18 already
 ,Backward and worse a waste of time. The age limit hasn't stopped anyone from getting cigarettes or alcohol yet so raising it will do nothing.
 ,Moronic.  Try and take away enlisted Joe's nicotine and there will be blood in the streets.
 ,Does he want a very angry Marine Corps? That is how you get one. You can fight in war but not smoke lol
 ,If a person lives long enough just about everything can potentially cause cancer that doesn't mean by then that they should not be allowed to do anything at all on that basis. People are going to do what they are going to do and adults should be entitled to do adult things simply because they are. It is a mistake to try to prevent anybody from living their lives because of their age just because age does not negate the fact even adults can make wrongbad and stupid choices and decisions and it doesn't simply stop happening based on the reaching any particular magical age.
 ,Backwards. Tobacco is good because it kills people before they start using welfare services like social security and medicare.
 ,Step Forward: If we can also raise the 'draft-eligible age' we might be able to raise the voting age where there's a better chance that these kids are closer to having an actual thought about the world rather than random idyllic thoughts.18-year olds aren't in a position to make any real decisions these days. It's the fault of our society as they ought to be able to do so and possibly even be married at that age. However the reality is that a lot of people are what used to be "competently 18" at about age 30 these days.
 ,I think military should be at least 21. A driving license should be 16 but should be much much harder to get. And that if you do anything dangerous like driving past 5 mph you lose your license. Young people generally just don't understand how dangerous driving is. 50k people a year die from it. Per capita it's mostly young people. I'm personally lucky I'm alive and never hurt anybody else in my car.As for drinking and smoking 21 sounds fine. Except the 0 tolerance doesn't help anyone. I think once you're 16 you should be able to buy one drink at a restaurant or buy 1 cigarette per day for example. Of course kids could go to another liquor store but they're gonna get their fix and not go over board.
 ,On Reddit people: I am a libertarian and sort of an anarchist! Do whatever you want just wear a condom! Life is really beautiful you know if you just let people *be* and do whatever they want to. We can all just do art and be real and drink IPAs and stuff.On Reddit people: There really oughta be a law against that kind of thing; someone might get hurt. And if anyone disagrees throw them in the concentration camp with the racists vapers Christians big corporations and people who hang their toilet paper closer to the wall!I have never encountered a place that is *more Communist* than Reddit. It is a collection of middle class pretentious and working class "theories." Most of this was absorbed by millennials -- the genetic byproducts of the destroyed family -- as taught to them by Boomers. The result is an entitled bunch of robot zombie Eloi brats who would elect Joseph Stalin unless he smoked or had sex without a condom or something horrible like that.Back to reality: why have a minimum age for smoking at all? If a parent is so incompetent than their child purchases and smokes cigarettes why are we trying to stop that disaster? Oh right we pay for it... well why not abolish that? No don't threaten "muh free stuff."On and on around and around it goes never stopping until suddenly --
 ,Maybe not 21 but I understand raising it past 18. I was 18 when I graduated high school (my birthday falling early in the year). If I had smoking friends who were younger I could get then smokes. 18 maybe considered an adult age but a lot of 18 year olds are still associating with children.
 ,I’m strongly against smoking tobacco so the harder it is to start smoking the better.  It just destroys lives.  I’d be happy if it were outlawed like they’re working on in Australia.
 ,Not a lawyer but because Trump only did things that were legally under his authority I believe you have to prove Trump's intent. Proving intent is hard.There was no smoking gun on obstruction. IMO if the president wasn't immune to prosecution there might be enough evidence to charge but it would be a very shaky case and either way would set new legal precedents.That said IMO this is a losing issue for the Democrats. The only way Mueller report would have been a winning option would have been if they had some smoking gun type of evidence. It will only frustrate the Democratic core because nothing will happen and annoy everyone else who is tired of the story. If they do impeach it will probably hurt them in the election just like impeaching Clinton hurt the Republicans.
 ,Here's a crazy thought. What if Trump hasn't broken any laws? What if he's not evil Hitler? What if he was duly elected and you just wish that he hadn't been?
 ,So far there’s no evidence of any actions just Trump bitching.  Trying to impeach him for wrong a whiner will just make him more sympathetic in 2020.
 ,NAL - Since the Attorney General is the arbiter of an activity meeting the legal standard for being held legally accountable for Obstruction the clear answer is No - because the Attorney General has explicitly stated that is their finding.  Now a corollary question is did any Trump ACTIONS impede the Mueller witch hunt?  Again clear answer is given the UNPRECEDENTED and WITHOUT INTERFERENCE access that Mueller had to white and campaign staff and documents No.
 ,Not whatsoever.    Him speaking his mind or saying "I'd love it if this happened" isn't "obstruction".&#x200B;Also... how is it possible to obstruct an investigation into something that didn't happen?    Hint:  it's not.
 ,Would it be fair to say that communism eventually requires a fading away if the state. Because even though capitalism has been defeated people may not yet completely accept the rule of law. Further that while there is a government in the early phases of communism it is made up of the working class themselves is a democracy and its goal is to eliminate itself from existence. As communism is a stateless classless moneyless society and economic system in theory?
 ,the same difference as in your coffee or beer. You want it super light decaffeinated  no alcoholwith a lot  of sugar and cream ?  thats  democrat liberalism.More caffeine and alcohol and less sugar?   socialism.Want the real deal to burn your tongue?  try moonshine  thats communism and also a health risk
 ,I’m not an economist but just an ordinary guy but my thought is basically that capitalism is not perfect but better than all alternatives as a whole.1.	USSR housing & employment: It would be good for the small group of people i.e. the poorest or homeless people but I don’t think it is good for the majority. Doesn’t that mean that house and job is decided by the government? What if I have earned enough money and now want to just stay at home for a few years to learn something to improve myself? What if I want to create my dream house where my children will continue to live?2.	Communism superpower: Isn’t that mainly due to the fact that they have a large population? And during that process a lot of people suffered and are still suffering under bad condition. The government corrupts and the managements of workplaces will have connections with the government which makes it difficult for workers to get their rights so no I don’t think it is good.3.	Oppressive: Isn’t Kuomintang the party of the current Taiwan? I think it is only because you are comparing the past with the current one. I mean if you compare Lincoln with Trump surprisingly you may find Trump is more left-wing even though all the Left think Trump is a far-right Nazi and Lincoln was a saint. For example I have heard that Lincoln thought Europeans are superior to blacks which was not a far-right idea at that time.I was going to write a counter-argument for each one but those are too many. So I will stop. But my point is again that capitalism is better than communism or socialism because even though communism/socialism sound nice on paper due to human’s nature it cannot work well.
 ,There are two ways to look at life: either everyone must be taken care of equally or we accept that life is conflict and that natural selection works on us every day.Conservatives come from the latter camp. We do not try to save everyone because we realize that people must save themselves and those that do not want to must leave us. This is necessary so that it is clear to each person what they must do and so that the good get rewarded; if you reward the bad you are punishing the good by making them do extra stuff for no reward while reducing the value of the reward that they receive.We support capitalism for two reasons:1. It works while everything else seems to explode like three-winged planes.2. It is an extension of the natural tendency to barter trade buy and sell which we view as part of life itself.We recognize that capitalism does not exist in a vacuum. It is constrained and driven by culture and so instead of government we tend to propose cultural solutions like mass awareness of ills and mass favoritism toward ethical methods.> Landlords charge high prices for rent and housing prices are risingHigh prices means limited supply. Perhaps we should not keep adding people to the population in such high numbers. We have also raised the cost of construction through regulation taxes and reckless lawsuits.> Large corporations are dominating the markets gaining monopolies and influencing the governmentThe best solution to monopolies is entry by outsiders in the market. That requires having a bunch of rich talented people with extra time and money lying around. The Left opposes this.> Without land reform all the land will be owned by large corporations who treat their workers badly without regulationMost workers behave badly and create their own problems; the few good ones need to be promoted upward. There are limits to monopoly and land ownership.> America has backed many capitalist and oppressive dictatorships as wellWhat were the other options? This seems like a political question not economic.> Capitalist countries are causing climate change and are exploring poor workers in 3rd world countriesThose third world workers are selling their labor on the open market. Do they have another option to get more money? If not that is what they must produce; if they cannot in the meantime they will take what they can get. If you can live well on $2/day that is a decent wage where you are even if it seems appalling to us. First world countries have more wealth and their currency is more valuable.> It was nationalism and poor harvests that caused the Soviet Union to break up Their system was always a disaster and over time people got tired of waiting for it to fix itself. It was also repressive and terrifying to live in so people had no faith in it.Perhaps nationalism did help break it up but it was the ideology of the Soviets to promote diversity and that forced ethnic conflicts to the surface where otherwise they had been kept separate by national borders. Then we could talk about the Russification programs in the Baltics...> Many communist countries were already poor and war ravaged as well as embargoed by Western Europe and America so they were at a disadvantage in the first place but they made impressive developmentsImpressive relative to what they could have done under other systems? It seems like they were poor got military technology and remained poor but had to throw their lives away for loyalty to the Party and its ideological agendas.> Capitalist countries see expensive education which keeps the poor in poverty and unemployed and expensive healthcare which many in America can not afford and end up going bankrupt because they cannot pay their health bills. While in socialist/communist countries there was free education everyone was assigned a job so there was no unemployment and free healthcareWhat keeps the poor in poverty is low IQs in most cases. There is no way to make them less poor; their labor is simply not worth that much. If all you can do is sweep floors you will always be paid less than a desk clerk. A society that insists on paying people all the same wage will find that harder jobs go undone or are staffed by incompetents.> The Eastern Bloc and USSR built homes for the homeless had no more famines after the 1950s and the majority of people got a sustainable amount of food through rations (although there was less variety and it was usually grain based) while there are currently millions starving in America despite fully stocked shelveshttps://blog.chron.com/thetexican/2014/04/when-boris-yeltsin-went-grocery-shopping-in-clear-lake/> Countries that have attempted to implement communism have turned into industrialized superpowers (Russia went from being a mostly illiterate and agrarian society to a literate industrialized country and the same can be seen in countries like China and Vietnam)They most likely would have done that anyway. Vietnam only achieved industry when it opened itself up to the West albeit in little dribs and drabs.> Many capitalist countries like Chile the Kuomintang in China Indonesia Guatemala etc. have also had oppressive governments massacres and widespread poverty and hungerThis may have more to do with the leaders they chose and the situations in those nations than the economic system they chose.> Under capitalism we see hundreds of thousands of homeless people in America yet there are thousands of uninhabited homes that could house them. In the USSR and Eastern Bloc (post-Stalin) they had housing for the poor and homeless as well as mandatory employmentFor a market to function there must be some unused capacity to enable speculation and upgrades.Furthermore the problem with the homeless seems to be widespread alcoholism drug abuse and crime more than anything else. Many of them are receiving a fair amount of money each day in donations from private individuals.
 ,The positive developments within the USSR coincided with its gradual transition away from communism and towards pragmatic nationalism. Communism's strongest grip on that country and its satellites in the early decades was also when the Holodomor and millions of daily gulag torture sessions were occurring. The US actually helped make Europe safe for communism by giving the USSR billions of dollars worth of aid through Lend-Lease.
 ,It's the only fair system that has ever worked and driven progress. Like any other system there will be drawbacks but they are nothing compared to communism socialism etc. One of the biggest reasons I support capitalism is it rewards overachievers and set higher and higher standers. It pushes progress and creates competition. In socialism or communism it doesn't matter that I worked an extra 10 hours and took short term sacrifices to save money. They in my opinion are essentially stealing money and slows down progress.
 ,I think most of your cheer leading of the former USSR and other similar entities is bold faced lying....
 ,Who knows? “He is a pawn of the president” is such an exciting news story. I don’t know why the spin doctors would tell it any other way so we haven’t exactly been getting the story from an unbiased source.
 ,It seems to me that most of the criticism of Barr is based on the unfounded assumption that there really is something damaging in the Mueller report and Barr is misrepresenting it to cover for Trump.  But now the report is out so we will see if there is any truth to that contention.
 ,It's over boys and girls. "Move On". Trump
 ,The AG actually said he was the ["President's wing-man"](https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico44/2013/04/eric-holder-im-still-the-presidents-wingman-160861)
 ,The presidents cabinet is inherently there to represent his interests and be his advisors. The constitutional assumption has always been that the interests of the head of state are the interests of the state. Looking back at President Obama is the best modern example of that playing out between an attorney General and president. Obama extended executive privilege to shield him from having to respond to a legislative subpoena. He also essentially sicced him on his legal opponents and the justice department entirely followed in line with Obama's desired direction. For better or worse that's how it is and I actually think that's how it should be.
 ,Why do you feel that only those two choices are applicable?    &#x200B;He works for the Department of Justice... which is part of the Executive Branch... not specifically the White House.   Did they teach Civics where you went to HS?
 ,Like with most of these indexes the categories they use to assess situtions are often subjective (like with any social index) we can tweak assessment categories easily to suit a narrative. Trump has often been hostile to negative press I would hazard a guess that most press around the West are more left leaning given the social nature of the profession so I would say that the scale is biased. However it can still be useful if an individual looks at the assessment criteria pf the index and personally agrees with the criteria categories ratings ect. Then they can use the index as a way of assessing the state of journalism in American. Or someone can argue that the assessment criteria is not correct and ignore the index.
 ,Not really since its essentially self-assessed and I don't trust the media in the US at all.  Reporters in the US aren't being locked up or beaten or anything like that which I would care about.
 ,>and condemned attacks on press outlets by world leaders including Donald Trump.Press makes its living by attacking Trump. He punches back. EEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
 ,How many reporters has the government murdered?
 ,I don't trust anyone or anything that implies that Trump merely speaking his mind somehow assaults or thwarts the press.    If my words can really stifle you like that... you were never free to begin with because you're a prisoner of your own mind and your own pathetic immature feelings (you colloquially... not you specifically).  I think anyone who quotes this garbage or puts any faith in it is a hypocrite looking for things to whine about...
 ,>Reporters Without BordersOh boy I bet this isn't a far-left organization at all.>the lack of international sanctions against Saudi Arabia were criticized.That's a matter of national security not something that you can throw around lightly. This is of course why the media keeps coming back to this point which nobody really cares about-- because they know their viewers will always gloss over complexity if given any avenue to attack Trump. Also I'm not sure how other countries not sanctioning Saudi Arabia is our fault.Basically the main reason that the U.S. has fallen is because of a vague "climate of fear" which anyone with critical thinking should read skeptically. The entire report is based on the erroneous assumption that Trump is incorrect in assessing the media as broadly untruthful and biased of course.We should also consider however that the organization seems to be intolerant of any criticism from the government of the media. Why should this be the case? The media is not infallible by definition it is not elected to represent the country yet it exercises extraordinary power over any democracy through its influence over public opinion. ~~Voltaire's~~ A famous quote which "free-thinkers" usually love is that to find who is in power look towards those you are not allowed to criticize. It's always open season on Trump and Republicans so who's really in charge here?
 ,The majority of the media in the U.S is a 24/7 anti Trump/ Republican fest while that party controls the executive half of Congress and the judiciary leans somewhat conservative now. That does not happen in a country without a free press.
 ,Because most of the red states don't have enormous metropolitan areas propped up by the taxes of multi-billion dollar international companies.
 ,Some of that has to do with incorrect assumption that a "red state" is 100% republican. Even the most conservative states only get around 60% of the vote. Even in a solid "red state" like Texas Trump only won with 52%. Trump only won very red Mississippi with 57%.  Most states are fairly evenly split. So just because a state is able to be dominated by one party that doesn't change who the actual people in the state are. There are tons of democrats in "red states" and tons of republicans in "blue states". And that doesn't take into consideration the fact that most of the "red states" that are dependent on the federal government are states that have to deal with the long-lasting generational impacts of slavery which has lead to higher levels of poverty and cultural division. And they tend to be states that don't have large mega cities with huge multinational corporations boosting the local economy.
 ,It's really common sense. Think about it. Blue states have much larger welfare programs and tax at a much higher rate than red states so obviously they have less of a need to rely on the federal government. If you want an honest comparison look at the number of people using these programs in each state -- obviously the results will be skewed if you separate state vs federal funds. That money all comes from the same place anyway.
 ,Bad science alert:> The analysis looked at the return on taxes paid to the federal government the share of federal jobs and federal funding as a share of state revenue.> > https://finance.yahoo.com/news/states-dependent-federal-government-180735773.html1. They do not use all factors. Big warning sign.2. They measure percentage of revenue; obviously for wealthier states this will be less of an issue.3. It ignores the prevalence of military and other government-sponsored industries in more rural areas.> But “it’s not really true across the board” Veuger said. “Virginia is a blue state and obviously has a lot of federal contractors and a lot of federal money … It obviously relies heavily on what the federal government does.”As the article points out this is industry dependent. Like the [propaganda from *The New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safety-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html?pagewanted=6&_r=3) this is a Leftist talking point designed to deflect from the fact that Leftist states depend on this aid while the rest of us do not.
 ,I have not seen this argument listed here yet but if you look at a red state such as Texas and look where most of the non discretionary spending (by far the biggest percentage of federal spending) went it is to a large degree in the blue areas of those states. Here are two maps showing SNAP usage by congressional district and party of each district. http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/snap-map-us-graphic.jpghttps://www.270towin.com/2018-house-election/map_imgs/house_default.pngThe correlation is far from perfect but if you look at a state like Mississippi which is normally considered a pretty red state the percentage of people on SNAP in the only blue district is higher than the rest of the state.In addition others mentioned military and other non-discretionary spending differences.
 ,This 'red state welfare' thing is passed around all the time in Liberal circles as their proof that Red states are full of hypocritical Republicans on welfare bitching about welfare queens.But these claims always use Federal taxes paid per dollar received as their metric.  All three of those above links reference the same article at WalletHub where to reach their conclusion they count any Federal spending in a state as "government aid".  That can include funding for national parks Federal highways NASA military bases research facilities salaries for Federal workers and anything else of Federal importance that takes place in a certain state many of which benefit the entire country.Some facts to consider:- Blue states have all the rich people: The top 1% pays like 70% of Federal income tax and the 1% typically lives in urban areas in blue states.  This skews the 'dollars paid' strongly in favor of blue states.  Its where the wealthy (ie. biggest taxpayers) live.- Red states are generally larger and less populated.  Say the government lays 1 mile of Federal highway in Kansas and another in New Jersey.  There are three NJ taxpayers sending money to DC to offset that Federal expenditure for every one KS taxpayer.  In addition larger states have more area to cover when building those types of projects.New Mexico for example ranks #1.  Its a state with a small population so any Federal spending in their state has fewer taxpayers to offset each Federal dollar spent in their state.  Its the home of Sandia and Los Alamos National Labs which receive over $5 billion in Federal funding.  That's 'welfare' according to people making this 'red state welfare' claim.So the entire 'red state welfare' starts with a false premise and lacks any nuance to explain their findings.  They just serve it up as "Republican states are welfare states and their voters are hypocrites" when the methodology doesn't support that at all.  But the headline is all people need to run with the idea.If you want to look at personal welfare SNAP section 8 etc. its not hard to dig up who is more likely to use those services.  Urban areas (which are almost exclusively left-leaning even in red states) have much higher use of aid programs and Democrats are more likely to have ever used any form of aid compared to Republicans.  California has 12% of the US population but 1/3 of the entire country's welfare recipients.Using an entire state to make this claim is just a convenient way to obfuscate the truth.  Even the most extreme states are only about 60% red and vice versa.  If you want to make this argument you have to show that Republican voters (not red states) are more likely to accept Federal aid than Democrat voters but the opposite is the truth.
 ,https://www.researchamerica.org/advocacy-action/research/research-funding-and-economic-impact-of-funding-by-stateHighly skewed and cherry picked stats...the MSM is really pushing this narrative. Of course smaller states with smaller populations are going to get a larger percentage “per capita”.Bottom Line...At the end of the day California wins as the largest suck hole of federal funding.
 ,If doctors are in favor of health then why do they have so many sick people in their offices?
 ,Because they don't tax their citizens to death.&#x200B;Most of the people in those states would gladly give up federal aid in exchange for being free from the rule of cesspool cities
 ,There's a problem with all of your sources. Let me provide you an example of the flawed assumptions. Take a state like California. When you look at the federal dollars sent to the state compared to what is collected via tax revenues you might assume that it is a net contributor of tax dollars.Unfortunately you forgot to check for subsidies. California receives a tremendous amount of subsidies in the form of below market rate leases.Example lets say there's a bit of federal land. And Walmart needs a new warehouse. The federal government leases the land to Walmart to build their warehouse but instead of charging market rates for the lease. They charge below the market rate. This is in effect a subsidy to Walmart. The federal government does the same thing for California cities municipalities and even the state government itself. Almost 50% of California is federal land and there is a tremendous amount of value in terms of natural resources and logistical importance to the land held by the federal government. As an example of the federal government leasing land below market rates take the Hetch Hetchy water system which is leased by the city of San Francisco from the federal government. The lease hasn't been updated in over 100 years and the municipality leases it for about $30000 a year. The municipality turns around and extracts the natural resources from the land and sells them from hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the public. This is in effect a subsidy to the SFPUC.If you count this subsidy and others California receives. They're a huge recipient of subsidies and while they contribute tax dollars they get them back by way of below market rate leases.

 ,It's reasonable to vote against you're own economic interest in favor of what's morally right. The Democrats want to kill unborn babies so if you don't support unborn babies being killed it's reasonable to vote Republican even if you're welfare check or farm subsidy isn't so fat as a result.
 ,I would love to know his reasoning but my guess is that he wants to preserve stability in the region by keeping bad guys out of power.Personally I would like for us to abandon the middle east and give Israel and Saudi Arabia carte blanche to do whatever they want.
 ,Trump pretty clearly laid out the terms in his first major foreign policy speech....in Saudi Arabia.  A speech that is criminally understudiedhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-trumps-speech-arab-islamic-american-summit/>But we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong – and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden.>Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here on this ancient soil in this sacred land.>America is prepared to stand with you – in pursuit of shared interests and common security.>But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves for their countries and for their children.>It is a choice between two futures – and it is a choice America CANNOT make for you.>A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. DRIVE THEM OUT of your places of worship. DRIVE THEM OUT of your communities. DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land and DRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH.The Saudis have been pretty good.  They've cracked down on funding for terrorists tossed a bunch of their own in jail supported regional action against the UAE for paying the Danegeld in the region.The price of that on our side is we support their little police action in Yemen.Welcome to the Sausage being made kiddies.
 ,I don't know anything about our involvement in the Yemen Civil War and I really doubt Trump is doing something that the military brass advised him against doing. I don't see this as an issue at all.
 ,We are supporting the Saudis who are fighting a proxy war with Iran.  I think it's the right call to keep fighting Iran as much as possible.  It's a dictatorship that destabilizes the region and are run by religious zealots.
 ,Knowing nothing about it it seems like the opposite of what he wants.  Knowing Trump he’s probably thinking a couple steps ahead and he is probably setting someone in DC up to look like a hypocrite.  Or this is just a DumTrump move.
 ,I'm not sure I understand your train of thought here:-The US has a program to provide health insurance to those with little money.-You are a recipient of that program.-You had an event where that program was needed because you did not have the money to have a good outcome without the program.-Therefore people with more money should also be recipients of the program because they would need it if they didn't have money?
 ,> If you were in my situation where I had been bitten by an animal that likely had rabies but the hospital costs would be $5000 and you didn't have Medicaid like I did what would you do?Hmm. According to the CDC in the last ten years about 23 cases of rabies have actually been reported in humans. Of those cases 8 of them originated from outside the USA. I'd say that the odds are pretty low. That said about 30000 to 60000 people still receive prophylaxis.  I think you have better odds of being struck by lightening. But that's just me.As for federal government sponsored healthcare that's a hard pass from me. I think in most states you can sign up for healthcare for a few hundred bucks a month and or pay cash. Even if you paid $5000 that's pretty cheap considering the number of injections doctors visits and treatment regiment for rabies. **Source 1** - https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/location/usa/surveillance/human_rabies.html

 ,We allow for third parties already.
 ,What article in the constitution or us code would you change to effect such a change?
 ,I mean we already have multiple parties.
 ,The United States has always been a third party system its just that it naturally becomes a 2 party. The problem with having a third party system is that it would split the vote causing one candidate to win over and over again. Imagine the libertarian party being on the ballot and causing a divide right leaning electors. It would give an advantage for leftist to keep winning.&#x200B;Personally I am against third parties because they either divide the vote or they have terrible policies. I would rather vote the Constitution Party than voting for a party that promotes degeneracy and unrestricted capitalism.
 ,How do accomplish this? How do you prevent people from choosing the party they want? What stops people from voting green tea libertarian now? How would you force people to vote for those parties?
 ,Yes. I much prefer European-style proportional voting and parliamentary politics. I am however European myself.Naturally proportional representation better represents the national population so it's desirable from a democratic standpoint.Proportional representation allows multiple parties to exist which gives each party a much more clear identity. Christian conservatives would likely be in a different party to neoliberals or libertarians and similarly the democratic vote would likely be split among social liberals and social democrats for example. Everyone can vote for the exact party they want without "wasting their vote".This is also good for forming a government. Right now either of the two parties will hold a majority and if the government is of a different party to Congress you can't expect much progress.With multiple parties a few would have to compromise up front on a plan and form a government together. The government would always have a majority and be capable of pursuing it's agenda while said agenda can never be too radical or partisan.There's a few proportional ways to count votes and any of them are better than FPTP but I'm partial to the Jefferson method (yes named after Thomas Jefferson) combined with open party lists.
 ,I’m pretty sure multiple parties have always been allowed....
 ,there have always been multiple parties.   what we have to throw away is the binary choice brain washing that if you vote third party you are   throwing away your vote or helping to elect "the other".     If enough people would shake off the my team is better than your team mirage (they both got us here) things would change.   but the herd mentality is taught in government schools at an early age and the brain washing is strong.   I did not start voting third party until bill clinton.   proudly throw my vote away ever since.
 ,We already allow for multiple parties. We have a 'two' party system only because that is the ideal state of our voting method (First Pass the Post). Some states (Georgia California Louisiana Washington and Maine) have already changed the voting method as this isn't something federally controlled. Although not all methods help 3rd parties. I'd say Maine's switch to IRV is the only one that might encourage 3rd parties. Changing the voting method probably won't immediately cause a lot of 3rd party success. As the two parties are ingrained in people's minds and it would take time for a new voting system to change that.There are also different governmental models that encourage multiple parties (proportional representation for example) but that is a bigger harder more controversial change.
 ,I think it depends on the changes being proposed. As horrible as the US 2-party system is looking at parliamentary systems abroad there's no reason to believe that a new electoral framework would necessarily lead to more diverse candidates with interesting things to say like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Ron Paul Ted Cruz Andrew Yang Mike Gravel and Tulsi Gabbard and etc.. As imperfect as the current system is we still see it give way to organic and grassroots movements which if not by winning are still capable of making changes and headway into the system.
 ,We get a lot of questions about reform to the voting system but so far no one has been able to establish:* What would be significantly different in outcome* That we would get better resultsEurope made politics even more complex and unstable with its systems. We realize that there are two basic tendencies toward preservation and toward equalization and we prefer the former. Having a dozen parties to split the vote would not help anyone.
 ,No they should be sent back to their home countries where they belong.
 ,I live in one so I don't need further convincing that they shouldn't be in the country at all.But I sure understand the point and I think liberals do need a taste of reality to get them to stop lying to everyone about it.
 ,I’m in favor of sending them to their country of origin to wait in line with everyone else.That said sending them to sanctuary cities is a brilliant move as the reaction points out how hypocritical a lot of people on the left are about the issue.
 ,I'm not in favor of accepting illegal immigrants but if we do take them 100% send them to the sanctuary cities.
 ,This is a perfect “be careful what you wish for” for those cities. Unless of course it was it was all political and not serious on behalf of these cities. This move will prove which it is.
 ,From my understanding the stance of sanctuary cities is that illegal immigrants are a net benefit to the country therefore they will not go out of their way to assist the federal government with enforcing the laws.   Why would they not embrace this newfound benefit to their cities?
 ,110%  I don’t believe the 4D chess memes but holy heck if this isn’t a checkmate.
 ,Absolutely no better place for them. Its a win win win
 ,I live in a sanctuary city.  I seen a bunch a liberal white folks go from "let's open our borders!!!" and now they are super quiet.
 ,Sure. Then they still get to break the law and live in the US like the liberals want - except they'll just be in certain places. I have no problem with immigrants but I do have a problem with those who think they are above the law
 ,Absolutely.  Its easy to sit in your home in the Bay Area or New England and tell people in border states that they're racist for not accepting a flood of illegal immigrants into their communities.If you're going to shield illegal immigrants from deportation put your money where your mouth is.
 ,I am in favor of sending them back to wherever they came from and following immigration law.   If they go to sanctuary cities the taxpayers are still footing the bill.      BTW there is no such thing as a sanctuary city under the law.   Federal law trumps local.   if a mayor is disobeying federal law then arrest them as well.
 ,100%. In fact any illegal coming from the southern border should be bussed to sanctuary cities and states since they love them so much and immigration is always 150% positive with zero bad effects.
 ,Sure. They need to go somewhere right? Why not the places that have volunteered to take them?
 ,It's the only logical decision. If it's basically illegal to enforce the laws of this country then go ahead and send them where they're clearly invited and the law isn't being enforced anyway.Things will figure themselves out eventually.That makes them no different than guests in someone's home. So it's a great move.
 ,Even though it's everything that liberals deserve I am against it. There is no guarantee that they would stay in these cities. If we have the capacity to transport them on a distance of that scale then I don't see why we can't send them back home. That is the right and safe thing to do (Leftists: You're welcome).
 ,my sanctuary city is slightly more republican than democrat I live in the most Hispanic part of the city and it is safe here so let them in.
 ,I'm not but I don't understand why the liberals in those cities would object to the idea of releasing people into those cities. They have spent years proclaiming that all are welcome; it doesn't matter how you got here; and offering them sanctuary is the right thing to do. Suddenly Trump wants to give you what you wanted and now it's offensive?
 ,Yes because I want to see these liberals publicly eat their own words and come out against it because it would be a bad thing for their cities. No because I don’t want these illegals eventually migrating to my nice unaffected suburb which is located conveniently close to one of the most well known sanctuary cities. If Trump does this which I doubt he will it’s not like these illegals will just miraculously stay in the sanctuary cities. They will migrate further into suburbs and rural areas that don’t want them. So ultimately I am not in favor of it.
 ,I saw an interesting Twitter thread a few weeks ago. He gave the history of two late Roman emperors one of whom was Constantine the other I don't remember his name but he came before Constantine. He compare the personal lives and the public rule of these two emperors and noted how Constantine's personal life was not really Christian as we would expect of the "first Christian emperor" but the other emperor's was. Conversely Constantine made great strides towards normalizing Christianity as a legal religion and a part of public life but the other emperor did not. In his public rule this other emperor more or less maintained the status quo.After giving this history the tweeter noted how many Americans view Trump the same way the Church views Constantine. Maybe not the most faithful or pious personally but he is ruling in a manner that does more to protect Christian's and the Church than others have.
 ,Well we have to remember that Saint Paul literally started off as someone who hated Christians and made a career of hunting them down for execution. Yet according to the Bible for some reason Christ himself chose him to appear to and convert so you can't impeach someone's Christian nature merely by pointing out that they failed to live up to the values in past acts. Such an argument fails on its face.However I don't believe Trump is personally guided by the Bible in his daily dealings. I'm sure a lot of his base moral views are atleast mostly entrenched in Judeo Christian principles as they are for most of the west but I wouldn't call him exceedingly biblical. Especially if you try and compare him to Jimmy Carter for example.
 ,> A former Congresswoman recently said of President Trump that "we will in all likelihood never see a more godly biblical president again in our lifetimes".In my view she is right. Christianity is basically long-term realism instead of short-term pragmatism like most people prefer and Trump has geared us toward long-term realism: self-reliance autonomy moral punishment rewarding the good exiling the modern Pharisees of the deep state and media making it so that good people replace our corrupt elites and so on.
 ,I think Trump is very biblical if you're talking about the Old Testament: capricious dramatic and prone to holding grudges.
 ,The only way to get rid of the debt is to cut the three-quarters of our budget that is entitlements and the voters so far have been hostile to that. Eventually the debt bomb will destroy the value of our currency so the voters will probably save more money by cutting entitlements but that is probably too much math for them. Voters like cash in hand and future promises are vague and not understood sort of like the Trump tax cuts.What Trump is attempting to do is make us self-sufficient so that we are not beholden to foreign nations or their economies which means that we will recover more quickly during the next crash.
 ,Australia avoided a reccession during the GFC through aggressive keynesian style fiscal policy. Injected a shitton of money into the economy so much spending that we've been climbing out of the deficit for ten years.However this only worked because we were squarely in the black prior to the GFC. I'm not sure America has the ability currently to avoid a large reccession. You guys would have to cut massively problem with that is your population doesn't like cuts. This is the issue with increased Govt. Spending when you seek to cut programs it becomes a moral issue. Why do you want to cut handouts do you hate the poor? And that sort of bull
 ,Averted entirely? Probably not but a softer than normal landing can surely be prepared for. IMO the rate hikes should keep continuing as long as the good economic times continue in preparation for when a recession comes and that can be used as a good measure.
 ,You can't indefinitely avoid recession but you can mitigate it through fiscal policy. Neoliberals tend to advocate for monetary policy instead.
 ,There would need to be massive cuts to welfare programs and infrastructure. Also sadly a massive cut to our military due to it being by far our largest expenditure. And quite frankly I don't see that happening
 ,Interesting... Someone did some research about published research findings being false and then published it. His conclusion must be false.
 ,This may or may not be a relevant link.>"\[T\]here is much in inferential science that is very reliable provided the inductive leaps are quite small and the data to back up inductive moves are substantial enough to make them very probable or likely. **The bigger the leap however and the more inductive moves required to arrive at the conclusion the more skeptical we should be.** Narratives about the history of the universe and of life can require a large number of inferences some good and others not so well justified not to mention an occasional huge inductive leap." [https://evolutionnews.org/2019/04/inferential-science-what-could-go-wrong/](https://evolutionnews.org/2019/04/inferential-science-what-could-go-wrong/) I've gone a long way from the blind trust of science I held in adolescence. Mathematics and logic are the only two fields in which we can have assurance that what has been proven true will remain true. Science is no more or less trustworthy than theology: both require constant examination verification *re*\-verification etc. as more information comes to us.This has become especially true in the 21st century post-modern / progressive era of science. The only field uncompromised by activists seems to be physics and even that has been horribly misrepresented by a clickbait-media. We know that the fields of psychology and mental health have long been [compromised](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/04/16/liberal-feminist-mother-warns-transgender-activists-are-taking-control-of-mental-health-profession/) and ditto to the biological-medical and biological-chemistry fields.I don't trust science more than I trust anything else. Trust maybe but verify; we seem to have a cultural amnesia for the "verify."
 ,The vast majority of conservatives would not agree with government aide to rebuild the French church.
 ,Its not the same thing. This money isn't to prop up a failed government but to help rebuild a historical site that is important to western culture. And the one thing you can say about American conservatives is they value western culture.
 ,> How come I didn’t see any cons come out against the (proposed?) donation to France for the burned church?I have not heard of this.It looks like private industry will shoulder the bulk. If the USA decides to make a gift as a statement of solidarity and goodwill that would strike me as appropriate.Notre-Dame is a cultural treasure of France and the Christian-Catholic faith and so we realize what a national tragedy this is and in times like that we tend to extend a friendly hand.> Especially when they have already gotten TONS of donations already from the private sector.The bulk of the donations coming from the private sector makes sense. However it is going to cost quite a bit to replace all of what burned.> This doesn’t even begin to touch on the typical fiscal conservative rhetoric or the anti-globalist usa first logic.How do these apply? We can only help French churches by... invading France?> Also it’s hilarious that this isn’t even a humanitarian crisis or anything it’s an old building being burnedIt is a cultural artifact that is symbolic and important to the French people.My cynical side also says that whatever we donate we will get back in renewed tourism to France which fell off after the recent spate of terror attacks.> we haven’t upgraded our infrastructure since Eisenhower.We spent the money on entitlements programs instead. Are you willing to cut those?
 ,[removed]
 ,Just hearing about this. I'm definitely against this but whatever. I wish things would get voted on by the people more
 ,Dont the reports say that Trump plans to personally donate in support of the Church? Where did you read that the federal government was donating?Also conservatives are widely against foreign aid yeah.
 ,>We all know conservatives whine incessantly at welfare & foreign aid.No that's not true.However I haven't seen that the US government is providing a contribution toward restoring Notre Dame. How much are we talking?
 ,I am not opposed to welfare and foreign aid funding I just have concerns with how efficiently that money is being used.
 ,I am Jewish. I do not feel it is safe to stay in the Left.
 ,When I was younger I just tended to side with my parents (both Republicans) because I thought they were smart so voting like them was probably right. Then in college I started to get more interested in actually educating myself about various topics. I went to a *very* liberal all girls school and we had to take this course where basically the professor preached about feminism and their very liberal opinions. One class discussion was about Disney movies and how evil they are for portraying women as weak for wanting a prince and how Snow White was raped because the Prince kissed her without consent... that's pretty much when I started speaking up more and questioning peoples ideas because I thought those claims were the dumbest thing I'd heard. Then I became way more interested during the last election. I started educating myself more and reading political books and attending events and stuff. I guess most of my views have remained pretty much the same forever but now I'm just more interested in discussions and learning about new ideas or outlooks on something and I'm much more likely to say what I think and why and not care what people think as much as I use to.
 ,I did called myself a alt-lite conservative back in high school when I was learning about politics in 2016 I had a political mindset like most Americans that believe in an ideological centralization of government. Then when I grew older and learn the concepts like federalism I started to embrace regionalism and localism as my primary belief of conservatism. Now I prefer the label traditional conservative or Paleoconservative-ish to describe my beliefs.
 ,I used to be far left since I grew up (and am still growing up) in a dominantly left-wing area of California and I was primarily only fed left-wing media. I used to think that conservatives were simply either ignorant or liked to use it as an excuse to be bigoted. Eventually it hit me that none of the beliefs I held were my own beliefs just things that had been spoon-fed to me. My naive self also began to wonder "if conservatism is so *obviously* wrong then why do so many people support it. Is half of the country just wrong? There has to be more to it then that right?"  I began to do my own research on conservative policy. After a while I began to realize a lot of their claims did make sense and their values seemed more in line with my own then left-wing values. It didn't take long for me to convert my ideology completely.  That being said I'm quite naive about the world and I wouldn't consider my views set in stone. However it's safe to say I'm not going back to the left anytime soon.
 ,I got pushed here by leftists and I will go even further right as long as this far left madness exists.
 ,Used to be a soft lefty like most highschool students but changed about a year ago to an increasingly conservative individual. The first thing that changed me was when i was applying for entry level jobs and got rejected by everyone even though my resume was pretty decent and ny interviews went average to well in my opinion.  However when two of my female friends who had near empty resumes and were rude and narcissistic to their employers got offers from nearly everywhere they applied i felt considerably wronged. My friend who worked at one of the places that they got into even told me that the only reason they were hired was because they were girls. Secondly what changed me fully was when I was introduced to Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro (dont cringe!!). They made sense to me when they talked about the problems with trans people and gender nonbinary terms. But when I even just  attempted to ask my friends about it I was called a bigot and clueless. I was an idiot and i needed to educate myself. Why was I basically being attacked for a view that in my opinion and many other peoples opinion wasnt even unreasonable?? I dived into right wing youtube after that purchased petersons book and a few other right winger books and have been becoming more and more conservative since.
 ,I went to a very upscale cushy private high school and thought everyone was a good person like the people I went to school with and that people who had a tough time were just victims of circumstance. When I got out into the real world I saw that alot of people I met were  living on welfare and abusing it making terrible life choices and wanting the govt to fix it saw first hand how evil abortion is and the propoganda surrounding it was a lie  how marriage and fatherlessness plague our society(I didn't know anybut one girl who's parents were divorced in school). In the end I realized strong moral values and hard work are the only way to have a good life and it's not the governments job to take care of you. I'm ok with social networks for the elderly and truly disabled people but our current system is just creating a cycle of poverty for able bodied people. I also went thru a phase where I believed that people should be able to do what they want (libertarian) such as decriminalizing drugs and abortion. Then I realized that drug use and abortion dont just negatively effect the person doing them.  I've realized that some things are just morally wrong and harmful to society and that I shouldn't feel guilty for not supporting an issue I'm vehemently against.So basically the real world slapped me in face. For a long time I hid my views bc it was looked down on to be a conservative in my social circles. Once I saw more main stream people come out as conservative and say the things I believed I realized it was stupid of me to not stand for what I believe in bc what other people think.
 ,I grew up in a liberal town went to a very liberal elementary and middle school as well as college.  My family is also really unconventional and extremely socialist/leftist with the exception of my stepdad.  Growing up I hated his viewpoints and thought of him as an anti-human rights bigot.  Meanwhile my own Father cheated his way through the welfare system and took as much from the government as he possibly could.  Still I remained a staunch liberal democrat.  It wasn't until fairly recently that I listened to a Joe Rogan Experience podcast with Ben Shapiro who opened my eyes to a lot of things I had never previously considered.  From that point on I began reading and listening to more and more political figures personalities and organizations on the right.  I really began to notice that being on the left has equated to a sense of moral high ground that is just so wrong.  Ever since I have changed my viewpoints I have received nothing short of harsh criticism and pushback from most of my social circle.  But I since have politically reconciled with my stepdad which is really awesome because our political discussions are so productive now.  He even told me that he knew one day I would probably change my mind.
 ,Agrarianism is a social philosophy capitalism an economic one. The two are totally unrelated and can easily coexist without one needing to be an "alternative" to the other.
 ,Agrarianism or at least de-urbanization and decentralization is a solid idea. To get there we would have to end our dependence on large cities and giant workforces; AI and automation could do it. There are efficiencies in the current system that would need to be duplicated if we want the same level of technology.
 ,As in subsistence agriculture?  You need land redistribution first (unless we're just talking about an agrarian form of wage slavery).  That won't happen without force.Alternatively we can develop the self-sufficiency principle on a more technological base:  Say some sort of hyperphotosynthesis for food.
 ,I support all steps towards autarky - as much as it's possible anyway. To achieve this we need to preserve what farmland we still have left. One alternative is to continue to simply build more subdivisions over more and more farmland. This might be a market-friendly "conservative" course of action. But given enough time all it will do is drive up food prices and create more dependency on other nations. We need to close our borders to curb excessive population growth. This would be a step in the right direction to enable our nation to better manage our farmlands and other natural resources. And we need to do this before it's too late. The truth is it may already be too late.
 ,First of all agrarianism can (and does) exist within a capitalist society.But no. The fact of the matter is that division of labor and the benefits provided by specialization and industrialization are far better than anything offered by agrarianism. Also we can't simply abandon our urban populations. China is trying to do the opposite right now (trying to shift rural populations to urban) and it's a disaster.
 ,No it would almost certainly be a step back on the evolutionary ladder.  I *personally* prefer rural living for many reasons but everyone growing their own food would result in mass starvation and collapse of society.
 ,we love life and that includes enjoy eating things  that could be harmful in the long term. Wanna be a vegan yoga practising liberal?   Have fun eating your broccoli
 ,You’re right. I’ll skip the bacon and go right to my chunky gray nutrient purée.
 ,I didn’t know bacon was strictly a conservative dietary delicacy. Outside of religion and animal rights views everyone likes bacon
 ,>For every 10000 people in the study who ate 21g a day of red and processed meat 40 were diagnosed with bowel cancerYeah I'll take my chances.
 ,Why do smokers still smoke ? Why do people drink alcohol?
 ,Because it is delicious. Next question.
 ,Maybe I'll die earlier if I eat bacon that's better than not wanting to live currently because I'm eating horrible tasting vegan stuff or whatever.
 ,I don't because it is against my religious beliefs.
 ,Your source makes no mention of 97%. Can I see the source for that?
 ,WTF are you talking about?
 ,>conservatives fanatically despise MuslimsFalse. We despise terrorists. It just happens to be a fact that a considerable number of them are Muslim and the reason for that is because *those types* of Muslims despise us -- and by "us" I mean anyone that isn't Muslim. It's not even all Muslims. It's not even most Muslims. It's a very specific type of Muslim.>Conservative Muslims are Pro-capitalism Anti-socialism Pro-god and traditional valuesSo... what you're saying is conservative Muslims are conservative? You don't say...# Without getting any further off topic the bottom line is that this is a [loaded question](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/loaded-question). The premise is faulty and therefore everything else is 100% irrelevant.
 ,Couldn't this be asked the other way around? Why are Muslims so anti-us?
 ,> Why do conservatives fanatically despise Muslims We do not. That is different from wanting them here mainly because if we bring in other cultures religions and heritages we lose our own.> even though they agree with them on virtually every issue?Not really since they have different methods of implementation and a foreign culture. We already have one and it has plenty of internal diversity so we do not need another.
 ,I do? I had no idea.
 ,>Why do conservatives fanatically despise "Muslims"You mean terroristFirst of all conservatives fanatically despise terrorist not muslims second conservatives are NOT the Alt-right and third I think there is a lot misconceptions between a muslim and a terrorist you see terrorist are those who uses Islam as an excuse to terrorize people where as Muslims uses Islam to spread kindness. In fact George W Bush (as much I despise him) called people like Al-Qaeda terrorist not Muslims.
 ,Christians have always hated hunted and killed anyone that doesn't share their beliefs. They even like killing other Christians who worship only slightly different. In the modern world they can't just kill them with a new crusade so they turn them into objects of hate instead.
 ,I think most people don't have the time to study climate change so the next best thing is to listen to scientists.From what I can gather most scientists believe humans do have an affect on climate change but the degree to which varies a lot.The issue has become very politicized and many warnings about the future have proven false. Like in "An inconvenient truth" they said scientists estimate by 2016 Mt Kilimanjaro will have no snow on top. The thing has more snow than before. The question becomes how much do we restrict our industries and hurt our economy (especially while others like China do not) which does hurt people to try to slow man-made climate change which we don't really know how much of what we are being told is true.
 ,Let's stop and really look at this whole "world will become unlivable" thing.Humans live across the entire planet and have done so for millennia *without* the modern conveniences of climate controll irrigation mass transportation and mass communication. We've lived in frozen tundra with nothing but animal blubber and shelters made of ice and built grand monuments to the dead in inhospitable deserts. The idea that humans will go extinct is a flat out lie.The oceans won't rise as much as everyone says. Ice displaces it's own mass so the only "added" rise will come from runoff from any ice seated on solid ground. And even then humans already live below sea level in several places I don't think it's particularly catastrophic.Fish will migrate or die with the shifting ocean temperatures. That's just straight evolution and has been going on longer than humans have been a thing.Maybe unpredictable weather patterns more powerful storm systems is a legitimate argument but again we've lived with hurricanes monsoons and massive blizzards since before we knew how to write.So the idea that the world will come to an end? That's fear mongering. It doesn't hold up to basic scrutiny.But there is an argument to be made: crop production.Certain foods can *not* be grown *efficiently* in high temperatures. Truthfully most crops can be grown anywhere to some extent but with shifting temperatures places that used to grow one thing will need to shift to others places that used to grow other things will not be able to grow anything. But as temperatures rise new lands for growing will open up. That one is pretty much a wash albeit there will be a period of transition that might result in shortages.So it's not that we don't believe in climate change. It's that we hear these arguments being made and they just don't make sense to us so we turn around and start asking 'why' until we get a good answer.
 ,The still completely unanswered question is **how much** of this we are causing.We already know we are in a 100000-year cycle of ice ages and near peak warmth according to that cycle anyway shortly headed for the next ice age.If that's not us then there is no hope of being able to change it.Meanwhile can you imagine what wiping out human economic activity would look like *this century*?  Because that is what is in reality being contemplated.
 ,Do you have a moment to speak about the Younger Dryas extinction event?  It’s not in our control  Saying it’s in our control is false we have no control of nature  The US isn’t even the problem with emissions see: China.   Wanting to bring the climate back to mid 20th century is a completely random time period I want the climate to be like the late Coniferous (O2GaNg).
 ,First there is no doubt that the 7 billion humans on the planet will collectively have a negative environmental impact.  Secondly it reasonably follows that nations should further the ongoing process of updating our best environmental practices as new technologies emerge.  However we should lead with our minds not our emotions.  We have already survived the following "crises": Silent Spring lead in the atmosphere  killer smog global cooling loss of the amazon rain forests overflowing landfills acid rain red tides massive oil spills extinction of bees ozone thinning polar ozone holes CFC bans coal ash spills ocean acidification fire ants rising sea levels killer hurricanes nitrogenation of aquifers and death of coral reefs just the name the ones on the top of my head.  We were told each of these items was going to kill us all in ten years.  Sixty years have come and gone with the alarmist never held accountable for being completely wrong in their dire predictions.  Rather the more incorrect alarmists are the faster they rise to "expert" status.  Finally it seems everyone wants demagogue the issue.  The mantra of environmentalists has been "you're either a true believer or you're a neanderthal." (Gore - extra chromosome). To give you a direct answer I believe there will be more humans on earth at the end of this century who will be living healthier lives than there are now.  I predict the complete opposite of mass extinction.

 ,Consider this: politicians like to manipulate people.  They like people to be afraid.  Because when people are afraid they are stupid and give politicians more power to "Save them."As with any "problem" the devil is in the details and so far ive yet to see any politician come up with a plan that makes any sense or is fair with regards to global warming.
 ,Negative maybe. Catastrophic probably not.
 ,Yes I do however I think that some regions will be more greatly effected by others and the worst will probably take place near the end of the 21st century beginning of the 22nd.With that said climate change isn't the only problem. Ocean acidification pesticide use antibiotics and plastic pollution are major issues which are only going to get worse too and have dire consequences on the flora and fauna of this planet.Innovation will do the bulk of the work to improve outcomes but humans do need to shift some of their behaviours for the better.
 ,I do not believe CO2 will have a magical effect of raising temperature. Most of Global swarming is pure bunk based on models that do not work.
 ,Sure it's possible to minimize the risks but we shouldn't destroy our economy in order to try either. Whatever happens will happens and humans are great at being adaptable. The one fact that the left loves to gloss over is that climate change is a natural process of the Earth. We may have sped it up with out activities but it's not necessarily harmful to the planet or even us as a species. We can work to make things better but it should be within reason.
 ,Short answer - NoI think the various model's predictions have ALREADY been shown to be highly inaccurate (recent cooling period vs predictions much lower temp increases vs predictions inaccuracy of the raw data adjustments by NOAH much lower ocean rises vs predictions much smaller ice-melt vs predictions etc.).  I also see clear evidence in the fossil record glacial record etc of much warmer and colder periods where a preponderance of plant and animal life survived or thrived.
 ,Conservatism is ideology. Climate change is science. I find it odd that you Anglos confuse the two.
 ,1. You are following a media illusion. You are simply a zombie stumbling away from the screen repeating what you have been told. Wake up!2. Climate change is a proxy for ecocide which is a far bigger problem.3. This topic gets done to death. People stagger away from their TVs full of the latest propaganda and come here to ask us to assume it is true. The Left has lied about every major issue they have encountered; the media is their propaganda organ; *why on Earth* would anyone care about what they say? Just disconnect.4. The solution to our environmental woes obviously is fewer people. This is best achieved by ending foreign aid globalism and the entitlements state. All of those are Leftist programs which is why they want a wealth transfer tax instead.Other posts on this topic:* [Who says climate change is not real?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/bb0snv/who_says_climate_change_is_not_real/)* [Do you believe that climate change is dangerous?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/av729p/do_you_believe_that_climate_change_is_dangerous/)* [IF the theory of man made climate change was 100% true would Government action be appropriate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/awukfb/hypothetically_if_the_theory_of_man_made_climate/)* [Will Climate Change be catastrophic?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/80qd64/will_climate_change_be_catastrophic/)* [Why don’t conservatives seem to care as much about climate change and slowly converting to renewable forms of energy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/arimhb/why_dont_conservatives_seem_to_care_as_much_about/)* [I would like as many reasons or explanations as to why Climate Change is not real/not a threat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/aqfchg/i_would_like_as_many_reasons_or_explanations_as/)* [What should we do about climate change?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/ar5poo/what_should_we_do_about_climate_change/)* [How do you explain conservative politicians unwillingness to try and stop climate change?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/aa7b3s/how_do_you_explain_conservative_politicians/)* [Do most conservatives think climate change is real or fake?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/adb8y9/do_most_conservatives_think_climate_change_is/)* [What would it take to get conservatives on board with climate change adaption?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/a6kw9c/what_would_it_take_to_get_conservatives_on_board/)* [Does you guys oppose climate change legislation and why?

Every person has a certain carrying capacity most of which is in the need for roads hospitals schools factories farms government offices exercise areas and housing for that person. No matter how much we reduce this our rising population will make up the difference.* We need less concrete. Local effects are caused when concrete reflects heat and smog traps it. Smog is a combination of pollution and water vapor. The best way to avoid this is a conservative society or small towns scattered across the land.* We need to stop subsidizing people. No free health care free education free retirement fund etc. We are generating a vast number of consumers who are also inert and tend to treat the world like a dumpster. This extends globally.
 ,Conservatives donate more to charities than liberals do across the board. We aren’t opposed to helping people- we just things the government sucks at it. We pay so much in taxes that it’s a real burden on to do anything useful with that money.The homeless in a community is the responsibility of the community not the federal government. Relying on the Fed for that is going to be less effective more expensive and more time intensive.Conservative ideals- a strong family unit a sense of responsibility pride in self reliance etc being reinforced will help decrease the homeless population. Homelessness these days shouldn’t be an inevitability. For those that do find themselves homeless that’s where churches and private charities step in but government regulation is making that hard as well.So basically deregulate cut taxes and put the burden back on the communities to care for their own.
 ,What is the plan for conservatives to deal with the poor and homeless? Personally they can do whatever they want set up charities job offers housingetc.. Politically absolutely nothing. It’s not the government’s or anyone’s job to take care of those that won’t take care of themselves.
 ,Well for one I'd stop putting so much emphasis on education as the big stop gap because honestly it isn't. There's not a city in America where a homeless person can't have somewhere that will free of charge teach them job basics how to type and use words and most will even assist with things like interview clothing. Also the majority of the homeless have personal cell phones and the vast majority have atleast access to the internet and the internet is the largest repository of human knowledge ever assembled in mankind's history. Ivy league schools even have their course materials freely available online so it's not a matter of this vast wealth of knowledge just being out of the grasp of the homeless. This is not to say that they don't have their issues that are affecting them of course but a lack of firm know how simply isn't the big cause.
 ,An actual pen-to-paper plan? Nothing. We're fighting other battles that will indirectly improve the lives of everyone including the homeless with resources we already have. For example one could argue that illegal immigration places an unnecessary strain on the homeless by using resources that could go towards them. That's not the point of this though.An unofficial stance (eg something most conservatives would agree 'That sounds pretty rad') would center around skills training and job placement with temporary monetary assistance. I don't know how many would agree with me but a lot of homeless are also mentally unwell which can either be a cause of or in response to their homelessness. Any plan dealing with the homeless *needs* to include mental health options as a consideration for those that would benefit from it. Likewise detox assistance for those who truly want to get clean.So you're looking at something like this:* Provide homeless shelters funded by the individual states (rather than feds) that keep them off the streets. This is *temporary*. You can come off the streets for a meal and a warm bed but if you're content being homeless you gotta gtfo eventually. Strictly enforced code of conduct (due to mental illness).* Offer skills training and job placement for those who want it you can stay long term as long as you show commitment.* Detox services for those who want it because the less desperate people running around jonesing for their next hit of meth or heroin the better. Again long term stay if you show improvement.* Mental health services for reasons mentioned above.It seems like our (americas) current objective with homeless is to keep them off the streets and "out of sight of the decent god fearing middle class". What we *should* be doing is treating the underlying causes of homelessness mostly mental health and drug use so it ceases to be an issue.It also gives us a chance to break a self-replicating cycle early. Many homeless are runaways; teens who left home to get away from abuse. But once you're homeless it's hard to get *un*homeless. Providing these people with a place to shave shower and get a good meal will go miles to getting them out of the situation *before* they begin to suffer the long term problems.It's a complex issue man.
 ,Private charity are far more effective at actually helping the poor than welfare programs.
 ,Most of the problem of the homeless comes from within the homeless. They have mental health problems or other problems which makes it hard for them to be stable.For this reason we have a simple plan:1. Make society sane so that only the insane will be outsiders. This is not currently the case.2. Make living as inexpensive as possible so that people can afford normal homes without being part of the rat race.3. Enable tax deductions for charities that can house and contain the insane alcoholic drug-addicted and so on.4. Allow local communities to eject these people so that they are corralled toward the shelters.> We need taxes to pay for better education and programs to help people get back on their feet. Our problem with education has never been spending although the Left always insists that this is so.
 ,Conservatives believe that its absolutely critical you help those who can't help themselves but its much better done on a personal level than a governmental one.   To often a government agency created to "help" becomes more interested in its self-perpetuation. A social support network is critical.  Churches food banks private charities (and real charities not the supposed charities that are really activism centers) hell even just carrying a bag of canned goods over to someone you know- all those are much better ways than relying on a government beauracracy.
 ,Charity for those who are truly in need.  Self reliance for the rest.
 ,Many people choose to be homeless.
 ,I have yet to see a homeless person brought out of poverty by government programs. Cut taxes and defund the government welfare programs. That burden should fall to local communities and charities.
 ,Stop spending billions on illegal immigrants and put it toward our homeless citizens especially the vets.
 ,how about we start by means testing recipients?   if you legitimately can not work because of physical impairment then ok you get benefits.   But if you are part of the group that aoc says "is unwilling to work"  then sorry.  or give them reduced benefits to make up what they make from their job .   they work means more taxes into the system and more help for those that truly need it.
 ,Generally conservatives favor private charities churches and institutions to help the poor through donations. However some if not all traditional conservatives do believe that social welfare should be a responsibility to state or local governments rather than the federal government. That way individual states can set up their own programs without relying on a very flaw national program and if they are unable to address those issues due to a poor tax base then they should receive funding in the form of block grants.
 ,I’m an Independant. But even the Conservative side of me wants more mental health hospitals and treatment centers for addiction. I think the Local taxes should be used for that definitively. There is just near to no oversight federally.
 ,Generally regulation should center around reigning in the inherent wvil nature of business.For example: No you can't kidnap children and raise them as biologically engineered mascots to roam the land demanding people buy your lead filled product. That would be an example of a good regulation.But there's a tipping point where the benefit the general population recieves is not consistent with the strain placed on the company (that is then invariably passed onto the customer). The ACA is basically the poster child for this.
 ,Investor confidence seems right to me within a limited scope but then again these may not be the investors that we ultimately want to have controlling interests in large corporations.As far as protecting "investors against the volatility of a free market and unethical practices of business that can hurt investment" that is a stretch. Distorting the market is a bad idea and having smaller boom/bust cycles may prevent gigantic busts. Further regulation shields many unethical practices by identifying only some practices and leaving the others not just legal but officially within compliance.
 ,Democrats tend to be more lax in border control but I don't see them becoming full open borders.  Really most of the opposition to stuff like the wall is just to thwart Trump more than anything.  The Dems have supported border wall/fencing in the past and once wall/fencing no longer means a political win for Trump they'll be in support of it again.  Plus if Trump succeeds in building the wall it kind of does a lot of the work by itself.  I know Beto says he would tear down the walls but I don't see that happening (not that I think Beto has a shot at becoming president).
 ,Certainly they will try. However there is no guarantee that the next president will be a Democrat. The policies of the Left adopted over the past fifty years have all ended in disaster and there is a cultural wave headed in the same direction.Democrats wish to play both sides of this issue. They have always been in favor of third world immigration but realize that they cannot openly say this so instead they sabotage laws and policies which might limit immigration. They know that if they get a third world majority in the USA Democrats will win all future elections and this is all they care about since they have enough money to remove themselves from the chaotic social consequences that will ensue.If Trump is able to build his wall continue eroding the Leftist legislation from the bench and build a new economy upon self-sufficiency instead of the cheap labor cycle support for immigration will fall even further. Election 2016 showed how many people were displeased with the "fundamental transformation" of their nation and wanted the old America back.
 ,What are you talking about?  Everyone on earth including all the Democrats and all the illegal immigrants when they are home are anti illegal immigration as we know from the laws of all nations except the USA Democrat voting records the presence of locks on everyone's doors and Cher.  They are all just lying about it because of Trump.  Except for Cher.  Jeez I thought that was obvious.
 ,If the next successor is a moron yes. Only a moron would disable board security of a country.
 ,I believe they'll have to run on "Open borders for all".  That's a losing argument in the general.  Like running on complete gun confiscation.  They can double down on going all the way but they won't get into office that way.
 ,Even if that was the case immigration is often one of the most important issues today. If we truly elected a Democrat who decided that he wasn't going to uphold the law wasn't going to support the legal citizens of his nation and was working towards the destruction of the nation I would think people would stand up. I think the nation is a powder keg and no one wants to be that person that pushes it over the edge. So I doubt this will happen.
 ,That is why we push for a physical barrier; if the border is protected sole by man and willpower then the next president can simply do nothing. But if there is a barrier the next guy must get funding to tear it down.
 ,Because we’ve had Republican leadership not necessarily Conservative.
 ,While taxes were lower during the Revolutionary war they were also more regressive. Additionally the colonies did not have representation for the taxes they were paying.
 ,> Isn’t it better to have a tax system that punishes consumption.Yes but then you will kill off the consumer economy which requires us to have a large underclass buying entertainment products with money they receive directly or indirectly from the government. If you can buy your groceries via EBT/SNAP you can spend your cash money on an iPhone instead.> It’s almost akin to slavery. It is but only when the money is misused. I consider consumerism which essentially subsidizes our demand-based economy to be a misuse.However we are no longer a frontier nation and we may need some income tax to pay for our military and national government. If we drop the three-quarters of the budget that is entitlements we could do this without income tax; if we dropped public education we could do it without property taxes too.
 ,Because there is one party.
 ,Because income tax is probably the easiest way to fund the government.  Many of the ways we funded the government prior to income tax simply wouldn't work today such as tariffs (because of global market liberalization and the proliferation of free trade) or selling off western land because well...we have kind of run out of west to manifest destiny.
 ,Probably because abolishing income taxes at a time where you guys are so unfathomly in debt is not fiscally smart. You guys need a way to pay off your national debt and get spending out of control. Cutting government revenue streams during such a time is only going to make matter worse.
 ,There’s a lot more to each situation. F my child was a commie I would feel like I failed as a parent. If my child was gay a lot more info would be needed to make up my mind.
 ,Communism.I've sucked a few *dangly bits* in my time. They taste salty at first then a little nutty. Nothing wrong with it.But communism is just *wrong*.
 ,Communism.  I dont care if they're gay  but if they're stupid enough to think anything positive of communism that means I would have failed as a parent.
 ,Communism because it means they haven't been listening to me or their history teachers.Being gay is a sexual preference. There's not much we can do about our attractions to other people. Being in favor of communism is an intellectual failure.
 ,Does any parent want a gay child? If you think your child's communism is more than a phase it seems like you would pretty much have to exile them or at least put them in a gulag. It could simply mean that they are brain-damaged; look for evidence that they have been sniffing glue.
 ,Gay is just gay.  Communism is transgender-level deranged.
 ,Communism. The first is probably something they were born with; it's not their fault. The second is at best a willfully ignorant choice.
 ,Gay. If they came out in favor of communism I'd think they were just young and dumb like most other kids. And I could probably talk them out of it.
 ,I've got no problem at all with a gay kid. A communist would be an indicator that I had fundamentally failed as a parent.
 ,I do not see him as a hypocrite for being rich and wanting the rich to pay more in taxes.  If he were saying that he wanted the rich to pay more taxes while writing in provisions to exempt himself then that would be hypocritical.  As far as I know his stance is that the rich should pay more and when that goes into effect he is willing to do so as well.
 ,He's only a hypocrite if he himself aims to seek loopholes to avoid the taxes he proposes. I don't think anybody has any reason to believe he would.If anything him being a millionaire proposing taxes for a group that includes himself strengthens his argument. Any broke college kid can say that the rich should be taxed but when the rich agree that they should be taxed it proves that the sentiment is to benefit the country not just the individual.Your friends arguments are baseless and miss the massive fact that it would include himself.I like to drink but I also believe there should be a legal limit for driving under the influence. That doesn't make me a hypocrite because I believe the law should apply to me too.
 ,I don't think it makes him a hypocrite.  Him voluntarily paying extra taxes isn't going to achieve anything he wants to achieve.I'm not in favor of a lot of tax breaks but I still take advantage of them while they're on the books.  I'd be a fool not to.
 ,Given his own lifestyle? Yes he is a massive hypocrite. He's fighting for an ideology he himself doesn't believe in. A system of economics he himself didn't apply to his own life. Bernie at the end of his life is rich and he'll never have to deal with the fall out of his ideas. We will. Sanders sounds great on paper until you dig down and question. Even the 1% at a 100% tax rate could not afford to prop up the social programs the left has suggested.
 ,I don't think it makes him a hypocrite I just think Bernie is too focused on what he views as "right" rather than what's practical.The rich have more than enough ability to avoid taxes or move out of the country. If he wants to scare that money out of the country than by all means he can try but I don't think he's inherently a hypocrite for his position.
 ,The guy is also worth about 2 million. Not exactly billionaire status but that is technically in the 1%. Which by his age is pretty doable. But it sounds like he's willing to pay his fair share if he had his way.
 ,No I don't think it's hypocritical. He consistently tries to enact changes that would give him higher taxes. I would've expected him to give more to charity but meh.
 ,I remember reading a book called "How To Make A Million Dollars With a Hot Dog Cart"  (I don't know if that's the exact title this was a long time ago).  It said the basics about dogs and buns.  It said to get two girls in swim suits to sell the dogs.  Went into some detail about the business side.  In the end it spills the beans and says something like "To make a million dollars with a hot dog cart all you have to do is write a best selling book about it."Oh I felt dumb.  Somebody sold me false hope.  I got duped.when Bernie Sanders was asked about the million he made off of his book he said "You can make a million too if you write a best selling book."  While pushing for equality and an uprising against the people that make more than they need... he keeps more than he needs.A kick in the apple bag for his followers.I guess what I'm saying is... Is selling a book on socialism by using capitalist techniques being a hypocrite?... No.  It's being smart.  Makes his voter base look dumb but I don't think it bothers him much on the way to the bank. tldr: "How To Make A Million Off Of Socialism?... Be Bernie Sander."
 ,Did you see him scoff when asked my his tax rate was so low and deflect to asking about trumps taxes?  Yes he's a hypocrite.
 ,> I think it is a sign of righteousness because it shows that he is not just passing policy out of cynical self-interest but is ready to make large sacrifices of his own income for the good of the country.No it does not and nothing does. You know one percent of the whole story and are drawing broad conclusions which is what voters *always* do in order to defeat themselves.Bernie might pay more in taxes but then he will generate more people to buy his book and vote for free stuff so he gains in terms of power. He does better in the end.The wealthier in this country tend to support higher taxes because three-quarters of the budget goes toward entitlements; those entitlements are paid to underclasses; those underclasses buy consumer products and that makes stocks worth more money Bernie worth more money Warren Buffett worth more money and the overall currency worth more money so that we can borrow more and tax more and everyone gets more.In fact the only problem is that people who try to make an honest living by getting paid a salary instead of working the usury system see their holdings fall in value and eventually get driven out of the system. Then at some point as all demand-based systems do the system collapses and everyone ends up in a favela.This is a typical outcome for socialism Leftism bureaucracy administration "good intentions" and so on.
 ,Does he pay the tax rate he wants those with his amount of money to pay? If not then yes. He could donate that amount to government programs.
 ,Seems only fair to give Republicans a choice.
 ,Libertarians serve one useful function for the Left: dividing the Right-leaning electorate so that Leftists can win.
 ,I don't think he is well known enough to make a dent in trumps armor.  He isn't stupid so he must know this.  I do wonder what he really wants to accomplish.
 ,I predict five or fewer delegates to the convention for him.
 ,Trump might as well be running against me he has no chance
 ,I'm all for challenging incumbents in the primary and wish it'd happen in Congressional races far more often.  But when the first reaction to a Presidential announcement is "Who?" that's not a good sign.

 ,He can Weld trump's god emperor armor  :)
 ,Can I flip it around and ask where liberals feel the compelling need to torture themselves with guilt over things that happened 150 years ago or alternatively things not under their control like being born into "privilege"? If I shoplifted a widget yes I should feel guilt and pay for it but if my great-grandfather shoplifted a widget there's no reason for me to feel guilty and obligated to pay for it. But a few points:* There were a substantial number of people against slavery from the inception of the country. But sometimes you make compromises you don't like because it's the only feasible way. Forming an nation incorporating the south was the only real way to form a new nation that had a chance to stand up to Europe. Allying with the Soviet Union was the only way to take down the Axis.* Yes we had a lot of adventures in Latin America and yes there's the matter of the Phillippines and Hawaii but we didn't colonize anywhere close to the extent Europe did. Look at a 1950 map of the world and compare American colonies to British French and Belgian colonies.* A substantial number of people do not think that Europe is better than us. Maybe as a liberal you do but that's not a universal opinion. Key talking points of course are the greater personally liberties here in regards to freedom of speech and due process (in many countries the prosecution is allowed to appeal a "not guilty" verdict witness how long the Amanda Knox case dragged on) how energy is so affordable even most of the poor can afford the freedom that cars bring and the right to bear arms.

 ,We are the most popular nation in human history. We're currently in a furious debate over how to handle the immense amount of people that want to flood in. Can you name any place that's unworthy of being proud of that has people literally breaking down the barriers to get in?But I suppose you'd like specifics? Our economy and the free market as a whole have lifted more people out of deep poverty than any other time in history. https://www.pewglobal.org/2015/07/08/a-global-middle-class-is-more-promise-than-reality/European nations are actually having to revamp their economies and tax structures to match or beat ours since their top talent is leaving the continent in droves because America has more and better to offer. On the other end of the spectrum the most downtrodden of the world are flocking here some granted just want a higher quality of life and to soak up free benefits via the social safety net we've guaranteed. And that's regrettable. However others I like to think the majority know that they cna come here work themselves for all their worth and their children can get educated and go off to university and get jobs where they can buy homes experience a standard of luxury unheard of in their home countries. Because the opportunities are simply that bountiful here.We're an incredibly safe nation (In terms of personal safety. In terms of property it's more fair to call us above average). For example there's a politifacr article where they "debunk" a claim that the UK has a massively higher rate of assaults and rapes in the US by essentially stating "Well actually that's not the case only looking at England and Wales and then projecting numbers for Scotland it's only twice the rate of the Americans" which is an insane statistic considering everything.This is quite literally the freest place you can be. This is the only place in the world where you can publicly say or publish anything that's not a direct threat of violence and not face any governmental harm whatsoever. You can easily Google cases where people in Europe were arrested for merely saying things deemed offensive there's the famous Count Dankula debacle in Scotland and much more. Technically the next time I fly to the UK I can be arrested coming off the plane because of some of the things I've said on my Facebook (Thank God I happen to be black which makes me immune to most of that somehow). Now liberals like to point out "oh you're just giving a platform to people to spew hate and white nationalists and anti vaxers". Which is blatantly true. They deserve it. And I personally am proud and happy I'm in a place where such people are free to publish and speak their beliefs. Allows me to debate them find out their sources the depth of their views where they're coming from and them to do the same to me ideally bettering both of us in the process. In a world where they are repressed and forced to huddle in secret meetings where they justifiably complain about the world being against them and scared of their truth they would hate me in that world. They'd hate everyone else. Our freedoms here foster debates and learning that others can only envy.Remember how all of the European nations panicked when Trump threatened to leave NATO? The reason for that if you dive into the facts wasn't actually just his bluster. We pay just under 3/4 of the entire defense bill for NATO. And just to be clear NATO is essentially the only thing that prevents Russian and Chinese encroachments into the rest of Europe. Yet the other countries are more than happy to for the most part ride America's coattails as we largely foot the bill for their security. This windfall means they don't actually need to have a "proper" defense budget and that money gets to go elsewhere (in large part to those social programs many college aged liberals go on about while not investigating how exactly those work and are funded). So even though I find the arrangement entirely unfair it is definitely something worth being proud of that your country is the single greatest stabilizing factor in the current world and has been for decades.
 ,We have more freedom and liberty than any other nation in the history of the world.That should answer all three of your questions. We ended slavery less than a hundred years into our history well ahead of most of the world. A large percentage of the world still practices it today after thousands of years. there are literally more slaves right this second in Africa than there were in the entire history of our country.
 ,Slavery was bad but thousands upon thousands of people died to end it here and we did it in 150 years where other countries had it for centuries. It's also a common misconception that everyone owned slaves in America when really it was about 5 percent of the population. Almost every country in the world has had slavery that doesnt mean the country is inherently evil. I'd look into some common myths about slavery in the US and you may be surprised.  Again it was awful but people act like the US was the sole country using slavery at that time and it wasn't. As far as intervening in other countries we kind of have too. You think we shouldn't have a presence in countries that have known terrorists cells or are run by cruel dictators?we shouldn't send aid to countries in poverty? PersonallyI think we should pull out and stop alot of foreign aid but not every intervention is unwarranted or evil. For example we have brought democracy to a bunch of countries giving thier people the right to vote. We pay for alot of European countries military and protection. You cant ask for us to pay for your countries protection and not expect us to have some people there to monitor. It's easy to romanticize European countries for thier free healthcare or college but the reality isnt as great as the fantasy.  70 percent tax rate for example take your paycheck and see how much you get back after the govt takes 70 percent. Govt run healthcare is about efficient as any other government run programs long wait times  end of life care not being as good as America  and the government decides what procedures are needed and which arent.  We are the freest country on the planet. We are the only country with absolute free speech our economic system has brought more people out of poverty than any other system in the world our poorest here are nowhere near as poor as people in 2nd and 3rd world countries. We have the right to bear arms and protect ourselves  you can practice your religion without persecution you can marry a man as a man without being killed. Our system has allowed for some of the most innovative medical technologies  you can start your own business and be your own boss bc the govt doesn't control our economy you have a say in your local elections. Your state too conservative? Move to another without a Visa. The list goes on and on.Does our country have problems? Surebut no where near the problems other countries do.id stop buying into the left wing propoganda that America is evil and people here are poor and oppressed and socialism is the answer. Its not we are not and the government already has too much control as it isyou dont want them having anymore.
 ,Every country has negatives even all those snotty Europeans ones who think they are better than everyone else.  No country is perfect.
 ,> It's a very pro-American song and I love it but it made me realize that I really dislike my country. Leftists like hipsters rely on being iconoclasts and therefore you must hate whatever the majority is doing.> How can I stop feeling ashamed of it?What horrible things has it done? Here are ways to stop caring:* Slavery was normal and had higher survival rates than either black ghettos or Africa* Colonialism made the third world much wealthier* Vietnam kept most of Asia safe from Communism* Capitalism brought us many useful technologiesI see nothing to feel bad about other than the fact that all of humanity is in decline *right now* and all of our decisions have been bad for awhile such as the two world wars our welfare state our civil rights laws and the weird hybrid of capitalism and socialist-style entitlements that brought us consumerism.> Why do you love our country?The people and the culture. My group WASPs are pretty much the only ones I know which is not from bigotry so much as like selecting like and there are some really great big-hearted but realistic people here. Plus our grand history like Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett Douglas MacArthur and Andrew Jackson William Faulkner and F. Scott Fitzgerald Jeff Hanneman and William S. Burroughs. The USA is not its government but its organic culture and it is truly a lovely place if you know where to look.> How can I be proud our country?Abandon Leftism. Leftism looks at the world through the lens of the losers. "It wasn't fair because it wasn't equal!" It is the tantrum of a small child who is ignored by his mother and scorned by his father. Drop that see the good and work to enhance that since there has been less of it since the Leftists took over in '45.
 ,If you woke up one morning and everyone you knew had disappeared.  You had $40 cash your clothes and nothing else.   In which country on  the planet would you like to wake up?
 ,There's a lot to love about America and lot for us to be proud of:When we liberated Europe and Asia during the second world war we didn't seize land nor did we punitively punish the aggressors instead humanely lifted them out of devastation.The Americans give the most to international charities.Our system has let millions raise themselves out of desperate hand to mouth generational poverty.We have the best freedom of speech in the world. Absolutely bar none.We've given millions of Iraqi and Afghani women rights that they almost certainly would not have seen without our intervention.
 ,See this is why I can never see eye to eye with liberals. What in this nation would make you not proud of your nation? When and where did you stop being proud of your nation? Every single nation on this planet has history that they might not like and they might not agree with today but America might be one of the few if not the only one that puts itself in a depression over it. America is the greatest nation on Earth. You're afforded far more liberty and freedom than any other nation. I think you need to sit down and really think about what you have what you've been blessed with and why others strive to come to our nation. Being proud of your nation is the default setting. You need to dig down and figure out what you changed in your life and mindset to change that setting.
 ,we are by every definition the most prosperous successful nation on  earth. we've never lost a war. there has never been a war with a foreign country on us soil. we have by far the world's largest economy. we've got so much to be proud of and think about where it all started. a rebellion against a corrupt english monarchy. &#x200B;slavery was only a thing in the unites states for 87 years that was 156 years ago. it's time to get over it. no one alive today has ever been a slave in the us. we have had a black person hold the highest office in the land for 8 years at this point it's time to stfu about racial equality. sure racism will always be a thing but that is a civil issue. if you want to hate the country because racists live here then you should also hate every other country on earth.
 ,It's hard to be proud of this country when there are too many democrats here.
 ,I can relate to you. When I was in my teens/early 20's I thought like you. I think for some more than others it's easy to see past the good things of something/someone you see everyday whether it be your partner in marriage your country etc. I would suggest you talk to some actual people from Canada who have had illnesses and had to deal with Canadian healthcare to see what the truth is on whether there are month long waits for care and how good/bad the treatment is. There is a reason why people with money from Canada come to the US because the level of care is (and again I urge you to do your own research on this) better.About slavery. Many countries had slavery... and most didn't have a civil war which freed them. In Africa slavery is still going on.About your mental health. Yeah it's hard but try to distance yourself from politics for a while. There are studies to back this up and you probably have experienced this that when talking politics peoples minds are often not looking for truth. The truth gets skewed and you can go around in circles forever. I try (unsuccessfully) to stick to one thing with a definitive answer or one that ends in an assertion based on evidence when talking politics. Like "Did so and so president do this thing" "based on this evidence I think he did"
 ,Don't let the bad things taint what's great about this place. Even as a total pinko commie I still love this country. We've always had really bad things going on and we legitimately always will and it's really easy to be impatient about these things because so many of them feel like they should have been solved decades ago but they do change and they will change further. Even in my lifetime the degree of improvement in acceptance of people for who they are or who they want to be has increased heavily. We still have massive room for improvement and so many things that obviously should have been done in the figurative "yesterday" won't get addressed until "tomorrow."Hang in there comrade. I know it's cheesy and cliche but be the change. It may seem grim like right wing lobbies have overshadowed the American as an individual but the greatest thing about this country is that we do still have a voice. We're still a relatively young country and just like how we got rid of literal slavery and helped expand voting rights there will always be other oppressive forces for us to fight and we can and we will *because* this is the USA.
 ,Hey just wanted to say thanks for coming around and asking your question OP! Makes me happy to see the two sides engaging with one another.
 ,Let me answer this by pointing out the hypocrisy in being ashamed of your nation at least as a liberal. Liberalism believes in individualism and in this case especially individual guilt not collective guilt. You can't condemn a "nation" of crimes and it's especially ridiculous to propose that "we" did anything over a hundred years ago because none of us were around back then.As for pride? Well it's much the same really. No point in taking pride in past achievements of a "nation" because there is no whole and consistent "nation". Past scientists and heroes are people we should feel indebted to if anything for their contribution to society and the world we live in now. A far cry from taking any sort of credit for it as a nation.However we just recognise that people don't exist in a vacuum and so there is indeed something one can be proud of. You can be proud of the liberal culture and society of your country the nation that upholds the values of liberty and democracy. You can be proud of your nation if it supports science or maybe leaves no one behind. You can be proud of what it is and does today because that is something you're a part of.
 ,We are not arbitrary in our reverence for the U.S. Constitution.  Our honor for it is not solely based on what it says but also that it does not say.
 ,I would support trying to amend that part of the Constitution because I don't think "free" healthcare would work very well. I would also support following the Constitution in the meantime.
 ,No because distributionist style systems turn people into mental slaves to the herd/state and you end up with East German outcomes.Let us review:1. Is there a need for "free health care"? I put it in quotation marks because it is not free. No there is not; people who are doing the right things -- responsibility for self -- currently can get quality healthcare although the cost is blighted by our past attempts to make it "free." Remove free problem solved.2. Is it actually better? The NHS and Health Canada are disasters. We would not want to emulate them.3. Does it have bad side effects? Yes if you consider the effectiveness and happiness differential between East Germany and West Germany.You cannot make a stupid idea good simply because you want something free. Nothing is free; you just shifted the cost somewhere else and will have problems in that area instead of the imagined problems that neurotic dipsomaniac journalists dreamed up because they want everything to be "free" in their simplistic delirium.
 ,I'm going to assume that you mean the constitution in it's original drafting an 11th amendment in the bill of rights rather than an amendment granted in todays times.The answer is a solid maybe.You have to understand that if that were the case it would fundamentally change the ideals behind the original amendments. Those first ten amendments being designed to protect individual rights and freedoms. With an amendment like that conservatism today would likely look very different.So the answer is probably yes. But only because we would have been raised on 250 years of different ideology.If you're talking about an amendment submitted and ratified in the future then no. And that would be a massive abuse of the amednment process.
 ,I'd probably want it amended out given that its unsustainable. That being said a free health care amendment would have been antithetical to the very concept of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in the first place.
 ,By definition Trump is not a fascist. Those that call him one are fools and I tend to write off everything else they say. He may have some fascist tendencies and I would listen to those arguments but that doesn't make him a fascist. Dictatorship - Trump may wish he were a dictator but he isn't. Forcible suppression of the opposition - Trump speaks against his opponents but he hasn't banned or jailed them. Fascism also tends to have more government control over business not too far off of what socialism wants. In general the name calling just makes me stop listening to whatever you've got to say.
 ,As a minority with Immigrants parents from a 3rd world country....I think people who call Trump a fascist are just people trying to make Trump sound evil as possible to finally claim to be victims once.  Victim mentality has no bounds!
 ,People who say that don't know what fascism is.  Trump is far from fascist just because he sternly doesn't care what others think doesn't make him a fascist. And that's not a bad thing.
 ,The confusing thing is that many people have different ideas for the same word. My definition of a 'fascist' is someone who thinks that he has the moral/intellectual superiority that no other person even has the right to object to his idea and tries to suppress challenging ideas with whatever means necessary often with intimidation and violence. So just for my definition I do not think he is a fascist. I think Antifa fits the definition far better ironically. Think about it. When was the last time that Trump tried to punch someone who opposed him? And when was the last time Antifa tried to punch someone who opposed them? Yeah...
 ,We have a handy guide to [distinguishing fascism National Socialism totalitarianism and authoritarianism](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/fascism).
 ,Mussolini advocated authoritarian collectivism. Oswald Mosley pushed for more of a democratic corporatism. There have been other forms of fascism in history but these are the two I am most familiar with.I don't see Trump advocating for either of these forms of governance. I support Trump but let's face it - like most Americans he probably can't even spell "fascism" let alone understand what it is.
 ,He does exhibit some fascist tendencies and one might certainly argue that he is authoritarian but I do not believe he is a fascist at heart. He may be an opportunist who doesn't mind resorting to similar methods at which point the distinction isn't very important but I do not believe him to be fascist. Really if you're going to call someone a fascist let it at least be Putin or Orbán. They act much more like fascists and have de facto turned their countries into one party dictatorships.
 ,What has he done that's fascist?
 ,Does that make Democrats Soviet Style Planned Economy Authoritarian Communists who will send anyone who voted for Trump to the Gulag?
 ,True IF Donald wanted a dictatorship with some sort of central planning of the economy indefinite suspension of elections and an anti-communist policy
 ,Anyone who calls Trump a fascist does not know what fascism is.
 ,I believe in conservative principles mostly.Dick is also really good
 ,The closest I can get to saying I can relate is being a black conservative in that black or gay your "default" position is supposed to be anti conservative. You're supposed to believe that they hate you and are working agaiabdt your interest. You say gay marriage was your thing and you made a statement that correct me if I'm wrong but for you put everyone into binary boxes those boxes being 1. Support gay marriage and therefore care about me or 2. Don't support it and therefore don't. If it's honestly that simplistic in your mind frame then nothing said by me or anyone here will probably be able to talk you out of it. If however you're willing to accept even the possibility that there's reasons to be against legalizing same sex marriage that don't have to do with hating homosexuals then that changes things.The question I asked myself long ago and the one I think you should ask yourself are "what are my principles"? Conservatism captures the core of what I consider principled. I certainly disagree with other conservatives about certain things or how to achieve some things or even if certain things are even a problem but we do all share a fundamental view about the world and the way it is and how best to harness that reality.
 ,Not all people who are homosexual think that gay marriage is a good idea. There is no requirement that you drop your brain at the door in order to endorse something so that it can serve as a symbol of power for your identity special interest group.In the same way there are homosexual Christians despite knowing that Jesus and Friends were not too happy about sodomy.Further not every homosexual person has joined the brain-dead march to the great Equality in the sky. Many are realists and if they are they tend to be conservatives.
 ,> One guy who seemed to think that he is the informed one was saying that everyone (probably everyone on the Left) knows that the US government intentionally caused the current economic crisis to make socialism look bad.Here is the order of events:1. Venezuela makes tons of money from oil2. Oil market dips Venezuelans feel crunch3. Socialists promise Utopia voters fall for it4. Socialists take over5. Oil market bounces back Venezuela does great6. Socialists steal everything7. Leftists worldwide praise Venezuela8. Oil market dips9. Venezuela plunges into *Lord of the Flies* style chaos10. Venezuelan socialists retire to Switzerland with billions
 ,How does the U.S. have *anything* to do with the gross interanl mismanagement of another country?Isn't it *more* likely that as history shows massive socialism fails every time it's tried?
 ,Did it?  No.  Would it?  Doesn't need to.
 ,Would we? Debatable. Did we? Nope. Venezuela is facing the consequences of Venezuela's choices. America is Maduro's scapegoat. We're his boogeyman. He wants to tell his people that he didn't destroy a once great nation.
 ,The drop in oil prices were partially caused by the USA but not intentionally. It's a side effect of lower interest rate markets after the 2008 depression and technology advancement. Basically after the great recession interest rates were very low. The biggest barrier to accessing oil in the ground is getting the money to access it and making sure that the cost to get it out of the ground is less than the price you can sell it at market. When interest rates dropped we significantly lowered the cost of getting oil out of the ground. As a note there's tons of oil in the USA it just was never cost effective to access it prior to 2008. But then advances in fracking technology various sands and liquid technologies and low interest rates combined.All of a sudden you had an explosion of production in the USA. During which time fracking companies took the route that tech companies do. They leveraged themselves to the hilt buying up land rights dropping wells as fast as they could. USA became an exporter of higher quality oil (as compared to Venezuelan oil in terms of processing requirements downstream). More supply lower oil prices come 2014. Then fracking companies started going under around 2014-2015 and being consolidated. Look at the upstream oil companies 10 year chart to see. So now there's a lot of oil in the market low prices wells are drilled and it becomes necessary to keep them pumping as its better to sell low than not sell at all when you're leveraged and you need cash flow.Venezuela honestly didn't have anything to do with the explosion of US oil production. It was primarily low interest rates and advancement in technologies which made previous inaccessible oil accessible and lowered global prices.In terms of oil. If your national economy is primarily funded on one source that is prone to disruption by technology or cost barriers. Then you're going to have a bad time.
 ,One thing is for sure nothing has been in support of moral high ground.  There's a profit strategy at play and without knowing everything thats going on behind the scenes with Syria China Israel N.Korea Russia Saudi Arabia Mexico etc... it's pointless to assume anything.

 ,Have you ever had a loved one in the care of the VA the single payer system we have now? I am guessing no. If you had you would not want that forced upon anyone let alone everyone.How do I opt out of it? Or is it forcing me to buy a product I don't want to?Who makes the decisions for your healthcare. In the UK the gov't bureaucrats do not you.  Do you believe the gov't is better at deciding your health than you?Basically your only argument is costs. Can you show me anytime the gov't took over the market and costs went down and quality went up? Conversely can you show when free market competition raised prices and lowered quality?  I am guessing your only answer will be natural monopolies.We agree we are in the worst scenario right now. Massively regulated market.You believe gov't control is better we believe free market is. I've never seen the gov't do anything effectively or cost effective or better quality. Why would I want them in charge of my health?
 ,That the current system--which stifles market competition--has major problems does not mean universal health care--which stifles market competition--is the alternative.
 ,[The government is not very good at managing things:](https://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/23.2b-in-improper-payments-tied-to-medicare-fee-for-service-programs?eid=CXTEL000000466947&elqCampaignId=9366&elqTrackId=767fcf1b2a4d4313bff7c332c7f2f0d2&elq=fde877a5962d464aa25313e864db8ee2&elqaid=9845&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=9366)I don't see how a single-payer system is much different than Obamacare. Well-off individuals still pay an exuberant amount for health insurance through taxes while the impoverished still get it cheap or free. Along with that why should the healthy people have to pay more taxes so people who are unhealthy by choice get coverage for illnesses they easily could have avoided with a better diet and exercise? I think health providers need to be reformed just as much as insurance. You can't fix one and expect the other to be end up fixed as well. If they fail and make it the only option which many people don't have much faith after Obamacare everyone is screwed.
 ,Well... first thing is that I don't think healthcare is a universal right.Everything about medicine from diagnostics to long term treatment planning is *super-duper* hard *golly-gosh*. And to claim that you have the right to someone elses skillset basically tramples on the rights of the other person. So many people seem to think that a doctor is just a meer technician... but have you ever tried to diagnose yourself? There's a reason "WebMD says I have cancer" is a meme. Healthcare is a *service* not a right.Additionally the *current* system accomplished absolutely nothing and in many made things worse.* Upper classes continue to be able to afford their insurance cost just goes up a bit. No change.* Lower classes continue to use welfare and Medicare/Medicaid. No change to them.* Lower-mid and middle class sees their insurance costs rise to the point they can no longer afford them and upper middle class sees their insurance plans lower in quality to being functionally useless.And as to that last point for reference: The cheapest insurance I can get in my area is 3600 a month. For a person making 30k a year getting that insurance is the same as doubling their taxes and they see no benefit until they've spent 9k out of pocket in a year. Functionally useless but at least they fall below having to pay the penalty tax for being uninsured.So not a right and has provided *at best* a net-zero benefit thus far.But if we move to single payer would it improve things?Maybe. I can't really afford to increase my taxes. Of course I can't afford major medical treatment either so that's kind of a wash I suppose. And eventually the market will self-correct because companies really love making money. So I'll not make an argument regarding the cost in *that* regard.But I do have a question I like to pose. And at the end of the day this really sums up how the right feels about the whole subject. Why would you want the government to be in control of something that you consider to be a basic human right? To conservatives... that prospect is *terrifying*.Remember everything else is not a right *granted* to us. Rather they're rights that we *have* that must be protected from the government.Freedom of speech? Try and stop us.Right to bare arms? Try and take em.Right to property? Get off my lawn!Right to a trial to not be subject to cruel and unusual punishment the *very right to amend the constitution and change our government*.*None* of these are rights *granted* by the government but rather forcibly taken away from them at the barrel of a gun and the threat of a hangmans noose.The idea that we would call something a right then allow the very government that we innately distrust to manage it... that just makes no sense to us.But end of the day we just don't trust the government that can't fill potholes efficiently to manage out healthcare.
 ,There is waste but I'm unconvinced that the current system is the least bit effective. For a "universal" system to at least *compete* with the speed and quality of how things are now most people would struggle even more financially due to the permanent crippling taxation that would be required to cover the entire nation's healthcare costs.
 ,[removed]
 ,For me at least — because it isn’t something the government should be in charge. I want to pay for what I want and not have to pay for what I don’t want.    Some things are (understandably) forced upon us because there isn’t any other feasible option AFAICT — like police & justice system military fire dept. etc. These things are necessary because you can’t feasibly have police and courts run by private corporations. Military protects the whole country it can’t selectively protect me but not you. Fire dept. can’t reasonably protect my neighbor’s house but not mine. Healthcare/insurance OTOH can absolutely be given to one person if they choose to pay for it and not to someone else if they don’t want it or want a different level of care.
 ,I think it's bad policy though perhaps better than our current system which is also bad. You need to have price controls and rationing in a single payer system and those come with a lot of unfortunate side effects.
 ,> Don't you think that moving to a universal system would have so many benefits to so many Americans who are paying so much money in healthcare costs and still struggling with high deductible and co payments every month ?No because the problem is not privatized medicine but the fact that we have so many free riders including many who are not citizens.Even more socialized medicine does not work; Europe's health care outcomes are worse than ours it costs them so much money that they cannot afford a workable defense policy it depends on importing third world medical staff to stay solvent there are long wait times and poor quality of care and there is constant triage by bureaucrats in order to keep costs manageable.Ideally the patient would have a close relationship with a doctor that they trusted and pay only what they needed to. This relationship only exists under free markets which are the natural state of humankind and is destroyed the instant someone imposes an obligation to pay for others.If everyone pays for their own healthcare most do fine and a few outliers manage to destroy themselves. In fact most get healthcare which matches their own inclinations (cheap/fast conscientious hypochondriac etc.). The instant we impose regulations we have set a bureaucracy between doctors and patients.The *only* reason that people want socialized medicine is that they want free stuff. The "cheaper" option when you analyze actual health demands in America is a lie.I live in a medical industry city and watch a daily stream of refugees from Europe including the UK and Canada coming here to get medical care that they would not be able to receive under their socialized systems.Like everything else coming out of the Left "socialized medicine is cheaper and better" is nothing but a lie. Detoxify your brain from lies and life makes a lot more sense.
 ,European here "don't touch the welfare system!" is or at least used to be a common conservative talking point. The traditional welfare system has been important to conservatives across Europe and they've fought to preserve it.Bismarck's welfare system was the first of its kind more extensive than any that came before and Bismarck was about as conservative as people can get. The Nordic model is an offshoot of that as is the Continental Model.There's a few reasons conservatives might support extensive welfare systems. One of them is social responsibility. In more paternalistic variants conservatism puts the nation first and defends hierarchy by assigning everyone fair responsibility. That better off have more responsibility to those worse off.Another is stability. Conservatism is cautious towards change and prefers order and stability. Welfare buys stability. By providing the basic needs of the people social unrest is reduced as is the popularity of radical movements. Anti-communism was a motivator for many conservative governments to implement welfare systems.Nowadays "Conservatives" are ever more just neoliberals intent on privatising and outsourcing the entire public sector which has nothing to do with conservative values at all.
 ,No and I doubt the GOP would support anyone running against an incumbent President. Anyone who competes against Trump on the GOP side will split the vote and give the Democrats a significant helping hand. Given how dysfunctional their election house is right now it's a far better strategy to just sit back and watch them take each other out. There might be talk of alternate candidates but in a political strategy sense that's a losing hand.
 ,The RNC and Trump campaign have already merged. His approval rating among Republicans is generally in the high 80's. There might be some outsider principled conservative with nothing at stake that may run against him but it wont be competitive or even newsworthy. Short answer - no.
 ,Depends on what they offer. If a further-Right candidate comes up Trump will have real competition; if they run another Mitt "the guy from the cul-du-sac" Romney to come out there and repeat Leftist dogma in a conservative guise that person will be run over by Trump like a grape on hot asphalt versus a steamroller.
 ,The Incumbency advantage for a sitting President is huge. In the past 100 years only 3 presidents have failed to win their second term Hoover Carter & Bush Sr. (I am not counting Ford as he never won a presidential election) you could argue that they were all caused by economic recessions. If the economy continues to grow no one will be able to beat Trump especially because the [incumbency advantage grows as political polarization increases](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/ideological-signaling-and-incumbency-advantage/1598F3657E22CD138EAAC246432DFA72)
 ,You could start by looking at the background and upbringing of people in poverty. If it matches the socioeconomic background of the country as a whole you have the beginnings of an argument for personal responsibility. If poverty begets poverty which is much closer to the truth you have evidence that poverty is circumstantial or since none of us choose where we’re born misfortune.
 ,I attribute very little poverty to complete laziness as in someone who just can't be bothered to do *anything*. In my experience it more like a lot of people can't seem to string together a series of the right choices. Wealthier people screw up too but they don't fall as far or as hard.There's precious little we have to do to make it out of poverty and into at least the lower middle class where you can sustain yourself:* At least finish high school.* Get any sort of a full-time job. * Wait until age 21 to get married and maybe have children.That sounds simple but again in my experience there are **a lot** of distractions for some people who are trying to get that done: high school parties alcohol drugs sex etc. I've seen people hook up or get married and pump out a kid or two seemingly just to show their families that hey they're responsible (not really) and are adults (not really). Or they give the bad guy/girl *one more chance*. Or they buy stuff with money they don't have.I could go on forever. There's *a little* misfortune that happens but mostly it's personal responsibility. Do the right thing even when everybody tells you it's lame or nerdy and you'll probably be okay.
 ,I think the better question is: does this matter?  The role of government isn't to punish people who are lazy or even reward people who are not. The role of government is to allow people the freedom to pursue their goals. Guaranteeing that freedom means enforcing laws and providing basic social goods. The moral judgement isn't ours to make.
 ,> How can such claims even be evaluated?It would be nearly impossible to get figures on this because you would have to assess all of the people in the nation and come up with a uniform measurement for laziness versus misfortune.> To what degree do welfare benefits the costs of raising a child or other economic factors incentivize or disincentive childbearing? If you can make a decent income doing nothing that will be easier -- and better for your children -- than being out of the house ten hours a day.
 ,With all due respect this is a ridiculous question.  It sounds more of trying to be a gotcha stance on "if you want to bring up irresponsibility then you should be able to quantify it."It's like a question on healthcare that's asked of "what are the studies that *specifically* show that a free-market system is "better."  Stating that without evidence the claim cannot be made at all. The whole reason the line is not drawn is because these things are not black and white.  But is more than just people that agree with conservatism that believe this way that there is irresponsibility related to not poverty but misfortune.  Do you think someone that spends half their money on drugs and has a poor time affording rent for their family has misfortune "very little" to due with personal responsibility.
 ,>What portion of poverty is due to natural talent laziness personal irresponsibility or misfortune?However you want to evaluate this take a look at immigrants collectively especially hispanics and specifically immigrants with barely a nickel to their name and compare them with 1) poor blacks and 2) poor whites.And then look at the pattern of success of the immigrants relative to the other two groups.  Immigrants' willingness to get up at 5 a.m. every day and stand out in front of Home Depot all day hustling for work (and numerous other initiatives) has a lot to do with it.  Hard work.  Perseverance.  Initiative.  A lot of poor people lack all 3.
 ,Throughout human history we have had gender roles because the sexes are different and can cooperate only when they have complementary -- balancing distinct and unequal -- roles.If you want to do an A+ job as a parent the dad works and the mom takes care of the home and they love each other dearly and spend their time with each other and no one watches porn or drinks too much or takes drugs and you can tell that she is the love of his life and he has been hers since she was the girl next door and he was the boy who pulled her pigtails. Dad is as men should be: masculine strong and aggressive but with a heart of gold; Mom is as women should be: understanding gentle and nurturing but able to lay down the law when the time comes. Dad does man things; he hunts builds furniture smokes a pipe and read Plato and Aurelius (and maybe early Clancy) in his spare time; Mom does woman things: she cooks sews decorates manages the home and keeps You Kids in line. Everything is in balance and everyone has a unique role.If you want the C+ upbringing try the modern household. Dad and Mom are equals which means that every decision has a prequel in which it must be decided who will make the decision. The other party may then go along with that decision in good faith or subvert it because that way *they* get the power. Mom was probably Dad's 640th conquest and he thinks that he was her 40th lover but really he is the 450th penis that she has allowed into her body. Consequently both are always thinking about The Other Side namely that the grass might be greener with a certain ex-lover or living the single life or even in an anal gang bang with a group of rappers midgets and quantitative bankers. Mom and Dad both do the same things which consist of going to work watching the latest cinema and television playing video games and maybe entertaining drugs alcohol or swinging. The kids are like the dogs kept in cages and let out for their activities each day with the dogs going to doggie day care and the kids going to the Government school. Everyone is constantly jockeying for power because there are no complementary roles *but* they get to indulge in the lottery-playing fantasy that maybe today *they* will be King God or Bill Gates. Children stagger out of his home hollow-eyed and unable to bond.Most of you get something somewhere between the two and you owe it to yourself to ask yourself which extreme you would prefer to be the majority of your childhood and that of your children.This is what gender roles mean. As far as transgenders there are a few Wendy O. Williams people out there who should be left alone and a whole lot of people with moral and mental health problems who just want to be the center of attention that are currently mutilating themselves with surgeries that are making a *lot* of money for the medical establishment while the rest of us pay. You would really have to be a flat-out moron to support this mainly because it is an obvious scam to take your money through the drama of useful idiots sort of like the Great Society and New Deal were so there is little hope that the average user horde (motto: turn it off then on again) will figure this one out.
 ,Womans roles have changed mens seemingly hasnt and it seems like it cant.
 ,I reject the total annihilation of gender that has been in vogue for the last 50+ years. Gender roles develop naturally and intuitively for most people who are sane and free from the degeneracy of the modern West.
 ,Sure. I believe in climate change. I believe we can take care of the environment. I believe technology can push society into a better place concerning where we live. We can rationally improve the environment. Note I say "*rationally*" because the fear mongering and paranoia the left pushes with environmental concerns nauseates me.
 ,You can both be conservative and care about the environment but we approach it differently than Leftists.* **Environmentalists** attempt to find a way to shape human behavior in order to avoid damaging the environment.* **Conservationists** recognize that the needs of humans and nature are antithetical so the only solution is segregated spaces for uninterrupted nature.Conservatives tend toward the latter. We know that no amount of green dishwashers hybrid cars carbon caps sin taxes and recycling subsidies will fix the problem.
 ,Environmentalism implies something which is antithetical to conservatism: namely big government interference a la the Green New Deal. Many conservatives however myself including love the environment and would consider themselves conservationists. I’m glad we have national parks and wish more would be done to discourage urban sprawl such as eliminating zoning laws.
 ,Yes traditionally Conservatives have been pro-Agrarian which implies a need to protect the Environment. As a Conservative this is a very important issue to me and as a Christian I believe it is the responsibility and duty of the Christian to protect and preserve God's creation as best we can.
 ,Absolutely.  After all conservative and conservation both stem from the same root word.   Littering unnecessary and careless toxic dumping and waste are all antithetical to conservative values. Where Conservatives draw the line is the notion of using environmental issues to force social change.  For example we're 100% on board with the market creating better cleaner more efficient cars for us to drive.   What we're 100% against is the notion of forcing everyone to buy into that technology especially when its not at its most optimal efficient capacity yet. Basically it comes down to the difference between a voluntary yet socially encouraged undertaking and government force.
 ,Sure of course.
 ,Why are you asking us? If you could ask that on a liberal sub without being torn apart you will get a more accurate than ours which is basically “it’s not cool to hate minorities but every single conservative is a wealthy white boomer male Christian and since those are the oppressors it’s okay to hate them”
 ,If were talking America muslims support same-sex marriage more than evangelicals They also don’t have much representation in the government and are a minority - so it’s a matter of focusing on Christians because A) they’re the ones in government who actually affect people’s lives and B) a lot of people don’t even know any muslims so they’re not seen as much of a problemI think a lot of conservatives think liberals “love islam” simply because they don’t think we should treat all muslims as the same my personal opinion is you can think me being gay is the worst thing in the world but once you start trying to make laws against me then we will have a problem.And the fact is Christians are making laws against me muslims are not. You don’t see a bunch of muslims protesting at gay pride parades or beating up gay people. It’s basically a freedom of religion thing but with balance; think what you want about me being gay but don’t enshrine *your* personal religious rules on sexuality into secular law that affects everyone.
 ,How are conservative Muslims not conservatives?
 ,Because muslims are one of their voting blocs. Same reason they sweep crime statistics under the rug you don't criticize your voters.
 ,Because Muslims exist on a political spectrum just like Christians do.
 ,Honestly there is no way to reconcile this but two comments. Liberals don’t typically “hate” people. Islam is an atrocious set of anti-liberal ideas but that doesn’t mean we hate Muslims. The beef is (or should be) with beliefs not people. Some of the people of the right (Stephen Miller et al.) hate/dislike Muslims because they are racist; which is a different thing entirely. America actually has the most moderate Muslim community of almost any country. Muslim conservatism is pretty close in beliefs to evangelical conservatism. Totally different story almost everywhere else where significant majorities of Muslims support stoning of apostates (or at least claim to).
 ,I'm fairly liberal but I think I can weigh in on this issue. I saw a thread on exmuslim where op was complaining about something similar to this. They complained that Islam has a lot of problematic aspects that liberals should work to oppose but because the right is so anti Muslim (from the point of view of exmuslim and of the left) liberals tend to compensate and come to the defense of Muslims and they tend to defend it too thoroughly. It should also be noted that the Islamic population is so small in the US that they don't have a large influence over our politics. Any oppression by Islamic governments tends to be far away from the American liberal and has little to do with them. Any public action by an American Conservative is very noticeable by American Liberals so they are much more likely to react to it.  It should also be noted that American liberals are reacting to Anti LGBT Islamic oppression even quite recently by boycotting hotels with affiliation to oppressive governments. I have also seen a good deal of criticism of Saudi Arabia as an Islamic country because of its oppressiveness towards women its violence towards Khashoggi and its perceived unjust war with Yemen. I think part of the reluctance towards criticizing Islamic people when they are clearly at fault may come about because when they see people criticizing Islam they think that they are criticizing all Muslims. It doesn't help when prominent voices like Ben Shapiro throw around comments like [Israelis like to build. Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage. This is not a difficult issue. #settlementsrock](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/25712847277?lang=en). Individual Muslims are also regularly accused of being Terrorists even though billions of Muslims around the world have never once committed an act of terrorism in their life. That's not just a conservative issue it's a society issue. Warning both of these are vulgar [Meme for proof](https://starecat.com/you-say-islam-is-violent-i-will-kill-you-muslim-meme/)  [Meme 2](http://ohsohumorous.com/index.php/Best-Memes-of-the-Week/muslim-memes-world-trade-center). These kinds of things happen regularly. When public discourse moves in this direction it dehumanizes entire populations of people which is wrong in itself but it is also [the fourth step to genocide](https://genocideeducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ten_stages_of_genocide.pdf). Dehumanizing people makes it much easier to commit violence against them and it makes it much harder for them to speak out. I think Liberals need to grow a little bit of backbone and stand against both the dehumanization of Muslims and the immoral acts committed by them.
 ,Christian Conservatives hold much more political power than Muslims who make up less than 1% of the population. Christian Conservatives via the Republican and Democratic parties have been able to actually block the rights of LGBT individuals from marrying in the past while Muslims have not powered any such movement against LGBT issues.Therefore Christian Conservatives are the bigger fish to fry.
 ,Muslims are higher on the pity index.The Left wants to make everyone equal which requires that they raise up those who are less than equal.That means that any aspect of victimhood or insufficiency in your life can be used for pity points.Since we are talking about white or whitish Leftists here the ranking is something like this:* Non-white +2* Poor +1* Primitive +1* Female +1* Rape victim +1* Homosexual rape victim +2* LGBT+ +1* Disability +2* Orphan +1Non-whites get the same bonus of pity points as people with disabilities because to a white liberal non-white is two disadvantages: first you are not of the group of fancy elite people and second you are from one of those spithole countries even if only by ancestry but that means that your ancestors were incompetent and uncivilized. This is how white Leftists think.This leads to a pity rank or victimhood scale where lower numbers means that you have more power in the Leftist worldview:1. Non-whites from primitive countries2. Non-whites generally3. Disabled4. LGBT+5. WomenMuslims -- who are poor primitive non-white and possibly disabled from inbreeding -- outrank LGBT. This may change because the new excuse the CIA is using to infiltrate countries and support revolutions is a lack of LGBT+ rights.
 ,I’m sorry would you mind clarifying?Are you asking why Muslims don’t “hate” conservatives for being anti-LGBT or Are you asking why liberals don’t “hate” conservatives for being anti-Muslim?
 ,[removed]
 ,because muslims unlike Christians grow a spine in front of questionable cultural challenges. Where christians and conservatives  would be soo often pushed back with ease  by the words "racist and homphobic". Muslims dont care about those labels. Like in a recent case in the UK state sanctioned propaganda mandated LGBT teachings in elementary school...in an area with a muslim majority. Guess
