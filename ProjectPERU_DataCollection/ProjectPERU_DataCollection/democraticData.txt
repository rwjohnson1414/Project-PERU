0.) Then why isn't the Secretary of the Treasury in jail?

Stop with the warnings and DO SOMETHING.
1.) I'm eager to see their plans for making Trump comply
2.) Do something about it! Stop with the empty promises.
3.) He also sided with Putin over loyal US government officials. No wonder Putin, by his own admission, wanted orange baby to win. Trump is bought and paid for by Russia.
4.) That never seems to register with Trump supporters. They just repeat what Trump and Fox News says. That's some industrial scale denial.
5.) Joe Walsh... stop trying to stay relevant and go pay your fucking child support you piece of shit
6.) Friendly reminder that Joe Walsh endorsed Trump, admittedly voted for him, and ya know, the whole call to arms if Clinton wins thing. Dude’s trash.

EDIT: grammar
7.) Well ya, they got him elected. He loves them!
8.) Well why would he? They aimed at making him look good and Clinton looking bad. They literally had an army of internet trolls working to push propaganda that is pro Trump. That's like his dream come true.
9.) If he's not a Russian asset then why does he always act like one?
10.) Yeah golly gee whiz I wonder what's really going on
11.) He’s just now figuring that out.??Where have you been the last 30yrs. Everyone in NYC  knows where his money comes
12.) Thanks for joining us two years ago.  Care to catch up to the rest of the class' rage?
13.) I agree with Joe’s sentiment, but he should stick to guitar ( and grow his hair back)
14.) At some point this has got to be like making fun of the special ed kids. This is low hanging fruit and it's been done far better dozens of times before.
15.) And pretty stupid of him to never even feign anger once.
16.) I really expected more Eagles jokes in here.
17.) Can anyone tell me if Deadbeat Dad Joe Walsh has paid his child support yet?
18.) I can't stand Trump and feel if he a threat to the entire global community, but by proclaiming that only Russia caused his victory is ignoring the glaring issues missed by the Dems, and the true realities we all face as Americans. 

Time to start looking inwards rather than out.
19.) [removed]
20.) Of the last several presidents, only one willingly killed Russian military personnel because they weren't in a place that is good for the USA, guess which president?
21.) Why shouldn't he do this, there has been zero repercussions for his laundry list of high crimes and misdemeanors, including treason.
22.) some democrats still prefer protectionism. i dont know what it will take to convince them otherwise.
23.) How long until Russia creates evidence against this guy
24.) I remember Bernie Sanders suggesting this in 2016 and paying for it with a Wall Street tax on derivatives. Most moderate Dems clapped back with "How are you going to pay for it!?" as though they hadn't even heard him. His proposal was just as detailed as Warren's is. I'm glad people are coming around to the idea though.
25.) This is just the political version of “THE SIMPSONS DID IT” but Warren is South Park and Bernie is the Simpsons.
26.) This is the equivalent of a stuffy noble using a white glove to slap both cheeks of the servile peasant (Democratic controlled House). It is yet another provocation that the Dems will probably ignore. It's like the Dems are afraid to act on noncompliance. It's shockingly disappointing.
27.) Ironic that draining the swamp would require hiring one of the oldest ones we own in Wilber Ross.
28.) The "old guard" of the Dems don't understand the game has changed and are operating on outdated principles. There are fights that must be had, such as defending Omar, starting impeachment proceedings, etc., but instead Dems appear unwilling to engage - and that will drive away voters.
29.) I've been a Democrat for 28 years and let's all be honest. The Democrats don't have any balls. When someone in your own party is attacked nobody defends them. Omar criticized Israel and was called antisemitic. When you have a report about the current president it takes weeks for you to subpoena it. Nancy Pelosi even said that she wouldn't impeach the president. These older generation Democrats in office are extremely weak. 

I can't wait for the younger generation to come in and have balls.
30.) If your fighting fairly in a fight you are getting your ass kicked. Stop being the paragon of virtue and start being an enemy combatant.
31.) Nothing will get turned over. People will fuss about how illegal/wrong it is. AG Barr will make sure everyone knows Trump is above the law. 

&#x200B;

This shit never changes. Get out and vote
32.) Once this deadline comes and goes with no cooperation, the House must immediately begin Impeachment proceedings.
33.) If Trump doesn't release the returns, Nancy Pelosi might give him a stern glare.  That is, if she's *really* angry and brave that day.
34.) It's not a deadline if it doesn't have consequences
35.) They won't be handed over.  I can guarantee it.
36.) WHO is refusing to hand them over?
37.) Nothing will happen until the dems control the senate and the house
38.) Isn’t this the second or third “deadline”?  I’m sick of the house and Congress giving empty threats.  Put something on the line
39.) Arrest warrant for the irs Commissioner?
40.) IMPEACH!
41.) Members of Congress have a Constitutional duty under Article I to investigate and commence impeachment proceedings against the president.
42.) It would be a stronger statement to remain a republican and vote with the democrats
43.) Why are we handcuffing ourselves? Going high got us kneecapped.
44.) "We promise not to use hacked materials about the RNC either"
45.) Good luck with that.
46.) Here’s a concept: don’t do things that are morally reprehensible and problem solved.
47.) They already did wtf are you guys going on about. Arrest the fucking orange idiot.
48.) The Russians are supporting Trump right now. The Russian troll bots are still very easy to spot on all the same social media platforms supporting Trump and the GOP the same as in 2016 and 2018.
49.) To be entirely honest, I'm not convinced that's the case necessarily.

I could easily see Putin deciding there is more "fuck up the place" value in supporting one of the more outlandish Democratic candidates.  I mean, sowing discord in our population is a primary goal, and we're really susceptible to it right now.
50.) We need to keep repeating impeachment and accountability for his administration and the GOP. 

Contact your rep. Post it on social media. Do not stop. Do not let these people keep pushing the line.
51.) Only this time Trump is in power and can help cover up efforts by the Russians.
52.) Remember when he said that he thought they would help us?
53.) Isn’t it at least possible that now that we’re aware of the Russian interference, we’ll be more vigilant and suspicious of anything wonky we see?  I wonder if there’s anyone here in America working on ways to circumvent any future interference from “Ivan”?
54.) Given his reaction to Jimmy Dore's questions at the "Oslo Freedom Forum", I've no respect for Kasparov. 

&#x200B;

You should worry more about the internal influence on US elections then the tiny part Russia was accountable for.
55.) So far the only candidate I've seen who is seriously fighting for democratic reforms like this these Mike Gravel, who [is pushing for the Wyoming Rule](https://www.mikegravel.org/issues/wyoming/), among other important political reforms like national ranked-choice voting and term limits for federal judges.

Anyone who is serious about seeing a more democratic America should consider [donating to his campaign](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mikegravel2020) so that his ideas can reach a broader audience. These reforms are crucial to ensure the Republicans do not have a stranglehold on our government for centuries to come, and we as Democrats have a duty to fight for them.
56.) This is really the GOP endgame. When the Republican party is free to exclude everyone they don't like from the census, they have the freedom to essentially gerrymander the entire House and distribute electoral college votes however they want.
57.) [removed]
58.) That’s a low blow, even for the demented delinquent...
59.) Compromised idiot
60.) The report makes Trump look like an utter buffoon - too stupid and incompetent to know what he was getting into. At the same time, I'm relieved that was the case because the practical realities of a sitting president actively conspiring with a hostile foreign nation is very scary.
61.) I hear he thinks dihydrogen monoxide should be pumped into the home of every American.
62.) "we have evidence that he's gay!"
63.) There really isn't much to go by, good or bad.
64.) How much do you want to bet the anonymous person from a rival campaign is from The Bernie camp? Taking money from lobbyists? Who else would say that?
65.) The man has taken money from lobbyists/PACS. That’s all the dirt you need.
66.)  You mean besides the unfortunate surname? "All rise for President BootyGag!"
67.) And I think we know which “rival.”
68.) [removed]
69.) Trump is just being flagrant now. Trump's like "It's Time to Get Rice Krispy and Snap, Crackle and Pop those Democrats". He's daring the Dems to even try and do something about it.
70.) Start holding people in contempt.
71.) California 2020 Election

72.) Glad to have a steady, experienced hand at the tiller of the House during these troubled times.
73.) It'll give the Trump base more incentive to turn out in 2020, and it won't work anyways with the current senate. So instead of talking about what we can't do, let's focus on what we can pass in the house to give us some talking points to keep our majority and take the senate back as well. Borrow from the Republican playbook of 2010 and 2014.
74.) I am ready now, I’ve been ready
75.) You are blowing this Nancy.
76.) Aren't they in contempt of the order? Are the Dems gonna do something or simply extend the deadline?
77.) This is a bad idea
78.) Why isn't this a fair question to ask?
79.) Impeach Barr.
80.) Barr needs to be disgraced publicly for his history of fucking America. He won’t, sadly in some circles - the only ones he cares about - he will be lionized for saving this criminal president from the chop.
81.) In many ways the White House did cooperate, it's just that Trump expected everyone to lie under oath.
82.) What the hell?  Has he seen Trump's twitter?
83.) Lies. Deception.
84.) Well clearly, Politifact is liberal fake news.
85.) If you aren't scared absolutely shitless by this news, you aren't paying attention.
86.) It disturbs me that so few people are as alarmed as they should be about this. This is literally the next major step after gerrymandering Republicans are taking to stay in power permanently and abolish democracy. If this decision goes the way Trump wants, it will make all of the gerrymandering of past years look like nothing, give the GOP a virtually permanent House majority and gut federal funding for state and county level programs.
87.) This is easy for a member of the Senate to say.
88.) Great Senator, sounds good.  Which 17 republicans have you convinced to join you?
89.) I hope more people ON BOTH SIDES come out and say it.
90.) We all do. 

He’s a dumb fuck.
91.) I do see this as a main talking point for him, whether it’s used as a negative or a positive. As a gay man, I wish he wouldn’t be defined by his sexuality. He brings so much more, even if his experiences as a gay man do matter.
92.) The first gay man to run for president has this cross to bear.  It is what it is.
93.) I think the overwhelmingly positive press coverage makes up for any negative to do with this.
94.) We need to not kid ourselves. 
This likely isn't the only group, just the only one to get caught at the moment. They're are dozens of fat right militia groups that train like they're going to overthrow the government.
95.) They'd probly form a caliphate if they got a chance.
96.) The word you're looking for is terrorists
97.) You know if there was a left wing militia that was arrested under these circumstances that it would be 24hr news on Fox.
98.) ~~Militia~~ Terrorist group. Call them what they are.
99.) “Pro-trump terrorist militia arrested” fixed it
100.) The worse part is that it looks like the Border Patrol is working with this group, and possibly others. Militias are the unofficial wing of law enforcement because so many of them are ex or current members of law enforcement and the military.
101.) Trying to kill the politicians who try to take care of 100% of the population of the US
102.) But we're gonna need like 20 honest, decent, Christian Republican Senators in order to make this happen.  I doubt sincerely you will find that many good Republicans at all in the whole USA.
103.) No one on our side is arguing that Trump does not deserve to impeached. It does seem to be the "right" thing to do from a certain historical perspective. But as Democrats, we need to ask ourselves if it the smart thing to do. The end game is really important here so it's necessary to look a few moves ahead. I assume Nancy did the same thing and didn't like what she saw. Public opinion is super important. Currently only the Democratic base favors impeachment. Republicans not only oppose impeachment, but their minds are made up, no matter what evidence they see. This means that getting the 20 GOP Senators to vote for removal is next to impossible, since very few will receive any political pressure to vote against their party. Therefore it appears that the odds of the first ever successful removal of an American President in history are infinitesimally small. This then means that the almost certain outcome is every newspaper in America declaring "Senate Clears Trump" and everyone in Trumpworld proclaiming exoneration again.                                                                                                 We then need to look at the possible political effects of impeachment. Polls show that the middle third of America (you know, the ones we persuaded to give us the House last year) is very skeptical about impeachment, and want us to focus on the stuff that matters to them, like health care & jobs. This implies a possible political cost to moving forward with even televised impeachment hearings to Russia-weary country. Some people think that once all the evidence is presented, public opinion will change. Maybe it will, but maybe it won't and it all goes south with the public at large. Even if this scenario is unlikely, it is still many many times more likely than a successful removal. It's simply bad odds for our side.  Another question is why we would force a tough impeachment vote on our new House members from tough districts (the ones that give us the current majority) if in the end there is little chance at ultimate success? Voting for impeachment could hurt them with their voters but voting against would hurt them with their colleagues. I assume these are some of the questions Nancy is wresting with, and it's easy to see why she's so hesitant to head down that road.
104.) I recently read a tweet from Mitt Romney talking about how impeachment would only mean a prolonged legislative nightmare- while I’m not a political genius myself I think impeachment (as much as I want it) would only divide our country further
105.) Hell he even try to sell his son so nothing is off the table
106.) Lock ‘im up!
107.) The Democratic party needs to move forward and forget 2016,  they need to look at 2020.
108.) I wish there was more clear discussion of the "Nuclear Power secrets being sold to Saudi Arabia" story that broke a month or so ago.  Because it fits in a pattern of behavior of abusing the office and trying to provide things to other countries in exchange for bribes.  

We have evidence of plenty of things - but the severity of that particular selling off of America's power to the highest bidder, it would make it hard for any sane citizen to be okay with that. "Oh he is just a businessman who has never held public office, of course he can keep his hotels open, receive as much money as possible, and try to sell detailed information about nuclear power and nuclear weapons to a rich nation while avoiding using anything like proper channels or clearance. Nothing to see here folks."

EDIT - Why the downvotes?  I am referencing the President's representatives selling out this country - https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-nuclear-idUSKCN1R82MG

Trump's feckless bullshit will have real consequences for decades and I thought it was relevant to the overall case to be made against him.  I guess people feel otherwise.
109.) [removed]
110.) Did Mayor Pete’s policies not result in the gentrification of a number of neighborhoods in South Bend? Were a number of minority families not forced to leave their homes in those neighborhoods? Did he not take donations from the same companies that won contracts to build luxury condos in the same neighborhoods where those homes once stood? Are these not valid criticisms of the man?
111.) I suspect crimes that might lead to even more.
112.) The Democrats need leaders who lead.  Not politicians that go whichever way the wind blows.
113.) Of course, if they're not willing to go read the redacted report while they're waiting for their demand for the unredacted one to be met, how will they know what the facts are?
114.) Um there is a report that was recently released that seem to point at a few counts of obstruction.
115.) California 2020 Election

[General Election](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/vote-mail/#apply): November 3, 2020
116.) They do.  They have since day one.
117.) Is she holding back because she knows the process will be defeated in the senate or this whole thing is not impeachnent worthy?
118.) Facts don't care about your feelings
119.) Or we can just talk about it for a year and a half. And do fucking nothing. Because nothing is going to be done. And by the time impeachment starts he will be out of office or starting a new term. This is getting old. Either fucking do something or shut the fuck up.
120.) If the House sits on this it will be spun as "See, there was no criminal activity."
121.) Impeachment should have started the day he took office.
122.) Mitch has been posturing for this the whole time. He'll be able to say after the fact "the Democrats didn't bring impeachment when the facts were clear" and he'll be right.
123.) Democrats aren't going to do a damn thing except issue statements. Barr told them to go fuck themselves and they aren't doing anything about that. Treasury told them to go fuck themselves and so far they've done nothing about that. They simply aren't willing or able to even attempt to deal with corruption and bad faith acting on a scale this massive.
124.) Trump is waiting for Democrats to declare impeachment which at this time is a trap. While we can use all the Mueller report as political fodder to discredit and destroy Trump the temptation to impeach is very strong. I would advise against it!
125.) Dumass title when it has the answer in the article... "And sure, the GOP-controlled Senate can stymie any House-passed bill."

They tried and GOP looked the other way, why would Mitch take up a bill that not only embarrasses the GOP but also stops them from winning future elections, they love what the Russians did and are looking forward to 2020s results. 

Meanwhile dems are trying everything they can to drive the base out to vote, unfortunately hacking elections is pretty low in polls, because polls matter apparently...
126.) This is a bad take. Sure some people may decide who they like based on gender/race but that's also why people get irritated by the focus on it. 

More people voted for Hilary in 2016, I'd bet about 65% of the country would rather have her as President right now. 

Biden benefits greatly from the Obama nostalgia and those memes. 

Gender likely does play a role in it but it's a lot about how they speak and who they're speaking to.
127.) Biden is riding off of the  Obama  nostalgia and Bernie has the best  policies 
 (and the holdover support from 2016), Trump is the sitting president, Beto is the "young  cool one" with no substance and Pete has  only been in the news recently.

I'd say that wraps up their  likability to  college students pretty easily. As a former  politically involved college student, not all of them are and I'd say that  plays a  huge roll

Gender obviously is a factor here but none of the other candidates have the groundswell these have, regardless of  gender, except  for maybe Kamala,  but her voting record and past as a DA taints her in the eyes of a lot of voters. And if their groundswell is an issue, it's  more  of a problem with CNN, NBC, HuffPo, Vox,  et. al, only  giving  coverage to some and not others, hell, Biden got more coverage  about him  running than Gillibrand or  Gabbard *before* he  even announced. Which obviously is going to affect how the average college kid views the candidates
128.) Why does he word it this way?  Of course Trump isn't working for the American people.  Of course he's working for foreign interests.  The evidence has been public for years now.
129.) I'll give you three guesses...
130.) Because they were colluding and did a wonderful job of covering their tracks.
131.) Why did none of the people report it? They were too busy lying and trying about and to cover up their meetings with Russians.
132.) Not exactly what you're looking for, but [Trump did order campaign aides to try and find the emails](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/us/politics/clinton-emails-trump-russia.html), which would suggest he was serious about his public request for help.
133.) True. Well said.
134.) The political ads write themselves!
135.) It’s sounding like the illegal republican “judges” might actually allow it. In the case that they go through with a fraudulent census, what options to we have with recourse? The republicans themselves have proven to be a seditious, fascist, terrorist organization and now they are literally using illegal means to remove opposing representation. I don’t understand why there aren’t riots about this.
136.) There is a reason it's called the "House Oversight Committee"....
137.) So he went from 'Nobody wants to see my tax return.' to this. Fucking moron just lies and shits on the law.
138.) [removed]
139.) Thanks to all the Easter worshipers
140.) [removed]
141.) I heard Chris Wallace on Fox News declare Watergate was much much worse.  I laughed out loud.  What a buffoon.  Anyone alive during that time knows better.
142.) What’s worse right now is not what happened, it’s what is happening with the partisan divide and the desire to win so strong that the Republican Party refuses to do what’s right.  

We have the report, we now know with affirmation what happened. How on earth can Republicans turn an blind eye to that report? 

Why on earth are we holding the president to such a ridiculously low standard? 

What about all the arrests of people in his circle? What about the attempts he made at obstruction when several of his admin. refused to comply with his requests? 

How on earth are we excusing the behavior of the mob boss who asked his henchmen to commit crimes but because he didn’t...he’s innocent?

The president commanded that those around him commit crimeS! It’s like Watergate but easily 10 times in magnitude.
143.) the election fuckery *alone* was worse than watergate. imagine if nixon went to the soviets for help in stealing DNC intel. and yet, here we are. republicans have a habit of this, it seems.
144.) If you all don’t make an example out of trumpty over this, and have it removed, it will continue to do the same bullshit over and over again...
145.) What are they going to call this scandal when it's over?

I'm mean Watergate seems to have the one word impact like Hindenburg or Waterloo... What's trumps one going to be called?
146.) It's a bit sad that so many people are putting party over country.
147.) [removed]
148.) Extract or change? if your can run SQL you can alter a database.
149.) I want to know if the Russians were seemingly able to change the vote tallies.  

But I doubt they will tell us because that could lead to a very messy situation.
150.) Derp. Liberals eating their own as usual.
151.) Sounds good to me.  Open borders are crazy.
152.) fuck accounts like yours that just spam unneeded bullshit.
153.) i'm for pete and focusing my energy on getting him elected instead of fighting battles which, though interesting, are of no real interest.
154.) Sounds like a tax return "scandal" redux. 4 out of 20 or so Democratic candidates had turned in their tax returns when it was going on, yet you'd see stories everywhere about Bernie's tax returns. Now, zero Democratic candidates support open borders and you see stories bashing Bernie for not supporting them. And so it goes.
155.) I am. Close to Trump on that and free trade. Very unprogressive. FDR rolls over in his grave.
156.) Some of us are outraged, but a significant portion of Bernie's base aren't liberals, so they are okay with him being a conservative on issues of race and immigration.
157.) Just casual president assassination plans, nothing to see here.
158.) “Pro trump terrorist leader”
Fixed it. (Again)
159.) Another peaceful Trump supporter
160.) Bye bye.
161.) Murican terrorist aka magat!
162.) I mean it's so early I don't know if there is much of a reliable picture. You can get a snapshot, but it could easily change in 2 weeks entirely with little reason.
163.) According to the latest Emerson poll, Bernie Sanders is the only candidate whose base of support is majority people of color, at 53%.
164.) We can make somewhat of an inference based on the current state polling and the demographics of those states. If someone is doing well with black voters you would expect to see them leading the polls in those states with high concentrations of black voters. South Carolina is 30 percent black for example. The most recent poll I saw indicated that Biden was leading there by 16 points. This is also a state Bernie lost by 50 points in 2016.
165.) Ask him: @ForecasterEnten ‏
166.) Ok so your point is: Trump is too stupid to be president of the us and we should eliminate him?
167.) [removed]
168.) Adolf Hitler used to refer to the lying press of his enemies, as in the “Marxist Lügenpresse,” while today Donald Trump, disturbingly, does the same.

169.) Guess she won't be inviting him again.
170.) Graham isn't too comfortable around women, they terrorize him.
*edit: sp*
171.) This is what Inslee does and always does. He is the first to show up to the fight and will see that fight through. He’s been one hell of a governor and rep and he’d make even more of a hell of a president.
172.) Inslee is an awesome candidate, One everyone should take a look at.
173.) That is a very interesting take regarding selling their ads, that I hadn't considered.  I tend to agree...let them simmer in their own sauce until it's past time for their ads to have been sold, and then maybe sign on for a town hall.  It's not like Fox News is likely to look out for these folks in the future, after all.
174.) Science to support this?
175.) Evidently the 1 in 5 who do not want their children educated all live around here?  😒
176.) What teacher doesn’t teach climate change? In all of my science classes since I was in 1st taught us about recycling and keeping the environment clean.
177.) Such a charming bloke. /s
178.) Economic anxiety. Democrats should reach out to this fella and get his vote.
179.) Thinks Drumpf will pardon him.
180.) I love how they take every opportunity to prove Hillary’s “basket of deplorables” comment to be right on the money.
181.) Why do they always look the same? And they always wear sunglasses. It's like they're afraid of their racist views being tied to their identity or something.
182.) I'm sure Trump thinks he's a very fine person.
183.) “Pro-trump terrorist”
We need to stop giving terrorists like the one in the article the benefit of the doubt. If we don’t treat them as they are, vulnerable people will die. It’s happened before and it’s happening now.
184.) What a loser.
185.) Haha eat shit.
186.) He’s required to stay away from guns. How exactly do you monitor that? At least he’s being monitored.
187.) Once again proof positive who the deranged supporters are, ....every instance like this is committed by a deranged trumptards !
188.) They should gain a lot of victim points now.
189.) It also paints a picture of the Trump administration as incompetent and unfit to run a McDonald's, much less the United States government. I mean, we knew that already, but it's nice to have written confirmation.
190.) This report isn't telling us anything we didn't already know. Most of the content (and all of the basic foundation) of the report were already public knowledge, long reported by the media. The GOP Congress will ignore it, Trump will (continue to) decry it as fake news, and a deep state coup, and finally Trump voters will see it as nothing more than fake news and an attempted deep state coup; because that's the dunning-kruger effect in action.
191.) And here I was thinking trump was a real Boy Scout
192.) Congress needs to lay it out or as usual Trump will continue to to push no collusion no obstruction, they’re too many fence sitters who say well if he was guilty Mueller would have charged him, or Barr would have charged him. These persons are the type that the Fire isn’t hot until you touch it or the Knife isn’t sharp until they get cut.
193.) At a certain point adults need to come together and realize that any political party only has so much political capital...and they must spend it wisely.

If you could show me any chance of getting 66 Senators to agree on impeachement, then I am all for it (as much as I fear Mike Pence).

But at the end of the day, we don't have those votes, and never will have those votes even with the most compelling evidence.

That means any impeachement move will largely be symbolic to make people feel good.  I am not a huge fan of symbolic moves that are initiated solely that leftists can feel that the Democratic Party is serious about standing up to Trump.  If we haven't demonstrated that point now, we never will....and running thru our political capital to soothe the fee fees of  a large voting bloc who hates democrats just as much as they hate republicans, and 25% of whom voted for Trump or a third party, seems pants on head stupid.

So far the only arguments I have seen for impeachment are "We are honor bound to do so!" and "I really hate Trump and this is like laying a really hot insult down on twitter, it's bound to get under the skin of trump and his flunkies"...and frankly I think our time is better spent making sure that Trump has no legislative accomplishments to run on in 2020.
194.) Dictator pig!
195.) I thought he gave up running that business?
196.) Can he sue Congress to stop investigating him?

Can I sue the local PD to not pull me over for speeding? /s

201.) Radical. This will fix everything. Although the US only creates 15% of greenhouse gases. We can get it down to 7% in 10 years if we really try. Take that China!
202.) And yet they continue to use workers who pay exorbitant amount for their education, use the resources of the u.s. paid for and built by taxpayers. And pay nothing towards the society that enables them to have billions upon billions sitting in accounts here or overseas.
203.) And our national debt keeps getting higher and higher and wages barely keeping up with inflation
204.) Well, yeah... who do you think that big tax cut was supposed to help?
205.) I got a raise recently, of 7 cents and they had the audacity to tell me that was a big raise.

207.) Some corporations paid 0℅
208.) This doesn't surprise me one bit.
209.) It is not *necessarily* a bad thing for a corporation to not pay any taxes.  Taxes are paid on profit, not revenue. A corporation that brings in $10 billion in earnings but also pays out $10 billion in payroll and expenses has no net profits, and owes nothing in taxes. 

While I do believe that the GOP tax breaks are complete garbage, we can't decide that a particular tax policy is bad based solely on corporate tax revenue.
210.) Are we surprised? No. Appalled?  Yes.

Want a leader who doesn't embody racism? Then get out and vote!
211.) It doesn’t benefit Trump or his Cult to mention it, if it did there would be a dozen tweets.
212.) Wait, what should he do? Is it the President's responsibility to do something for every notable crime?
213.) The GOP knows they can’t win unless they cheat.

Fortunately, we can still outvote their shenanigans if we’re motivated...
214.) The entire turd and repugnant crime family needs to be sent to camps in New Mexico and kept under overpasses until they wither away.
215.) Trump, a wannabe mob-type boss, probably said to his underlings something like this when the Russians were helping him and these toadies wanted to do something to take advantage of it:  "OK, you do what you gotta do.  I don't don't wanna hear about it anymore.  And make sure nothing comes back to me.  I don't want anything to stick. Let the Russkies know I'll reward Vladimir later... when I'm in."
216.) Pretty much.
217.) Pretty much.
218.) Living in the alternative universe has got to stop, trumpstification must be squelched at all costs...
219.) As Mueller stated he cannot Indict a sitting president, but their is a road map to that possibility which the Republicans don’t want to acknowledge.

237.) Dems better pursue impeachment if they know what’s good for them. 

Showing the public they’re wishy-washy wimps who are not willing to fight against even a weak president who committed serious crimes will be electoral disaster.
238.) Only if we pressure our reps.  If the base does nothing our leaders won't out of fear the republicans will use it againsts them.  The only thing dem leaders fear more than republicans is the base.
239.) The old guard dems aren't up for trying to impeach. Even if they were, Republicans control the senate and there's zero chance of getting a conviction. And once the senate fails to convict, Trump and the GOP will spin that as a total exoneration and vindication of the president, which the media will pick up and repeat ad nauseum until enough of the electorate believes it to give Trump a second term and undo the blue wave we got in the house last year.
240.) This is how it’s done. Her campaign has been a master class of substance and unabashed liberalism, while standing as a champion for the working class. She’s my top pick in 2020 by far.

Interest payment as a percentage of our deficit spending continues to grow at an astonishing rate. Hopefully, we have a nominee who will address this.

277.) Keep in mind that Russian trolls are all over the internet trying to divide democrats so dont assume you are seeing real Bernie supporters.   Most of the Seth Rich stuff I have seen came from Trump supporters.  We now know that it was wikileaks and the russians who spread the rumor that he was the source of the leaks to cover themselves.
278.) No one besides a few crazies, and russian or right wing trolls posts or believes anything crazy about seth rich. 

Bernie Sanders supporters and popularity is being maligned by corporate media- in that sense cnn, fox, and msnbc are the same in their smearing of Bernie. 

Why are you letting trolls and possibly foreign bad actors influence your opinion of progressives and millennials and young people who support Sanders?
279.) >So, I don't expect an apology from Sanders Supporters or "progressives" for spending the last 3 years insisting that Seth Rich was the source of the DNC email hacks for Wikileaks, and that the DNC and Hillary Clinton personally had him killed for it. I understand that this apology will never be forthcoming.

I, a Bernie Sanders-supporter, have never insisted such a thing. It is a terrible accusation. But, I fully admit there are many, crazy Sanders-supporters. There are crazy Sanders-supporters who spread conspiracy theories—just like there are crazy anti-Sanders folks who insist that Sanders is secretly racist or misogynist, or that he was paid off by Russia. Sadly, this is true for many politicians’ supporters. Crazy Sanders-supporters are unusually vocal about their craziness.

Personally, I am of the opinion that Sanders’ platform happens to appeal to those who are generally distrustful of politicians or the status quo. As a result, in addition to sane supporters and those who just support his policies, this attracts lunatics and conspiracy theorists. And those misanthropes tend to be very loud and obnoxious.

So, although I have never pushed the aforementioned Seth Rich conspiracy theory, let me apologize on behalf of all those who have. They should not have done so.

>What I would like to discuss is...why after the release of the Mueller report, are all of the Sanders subs still insisting that there was a grand conspiracy to kill Seth Rich? Even though they are actively hurting a grieving family, and as far as I can tell, are not attracting any new supporters to Sanders by going on an on about Seth Rich. r/wayofthebern even has a sidebar link they added a few days ago insisting that Seth Rich was personally murdered by Hillary Clinton. Not that this is limited to just that subreddit, every Bernie subreddit was banging the Seth Rich Drum for such a long time...and many still do to this day.

I do not subscribe to r/wayofthebern. I find it positively insane. Their commenters sound like Trump-supporters in their level of insanity, just with a progressive twist. To be honest, I’m not very active in any Sanders subs, so I can’t speak for them.

What I can say is that extremists, when given a voice, tend to attract those who feel ostracized. As such, I have tried to decrease the ostracizing of sane Sanders-supporters in r/democrats. Many sane Sanders-supporters do feel ostracized by more “mainstream” democrats (or those who have been influenced by the extremism in subs like r/Enough_Sanders_Spam ).  I am of the opinion that, if they felt more welcome here, they’d be less likely to be swayed by extremism.

>So I guess My question to Bernie Sanders supporters is...why are you so horrible? Why would you use a young man's tragic murder as a plank in your "vote for Bernie!" platform? What do you hope to gain by continually insisting it's true?

As a Bernie Sanders-supporter, I’m upset that you find me “so horrible.” Extremists will do anything to push their agenda. If I had to guess, I’d assume they believe that, but pushing liberals away from mainstream Democrats, they’d default to Bernie Sanders. But this is just a guess. I also suspect many of them to be Russian trolls or Trump-plants.

>I keep seeing a lot of Sanders supporters insisting that Bernie is being maligned by the media, that people are dismissing his supporters out of hand . . .

Are you not dismissing Sanders-supporters our or hand by virtue of this post, though?

>. . . that we original Democrats must take your thoughts and feelings into account if we ever want to win another election . . .

“Original” Democrats? When I turned 18, I drove to the office if the head of the Democratic Party in my hometown so I could register with my local party. I vote down the line (D) in every election. I have convinced friends to register to vote. I have canvassed and collected donations for the Party.  And I’ve done this all years and years before Sanders threw his hat into the ring in 2015. Don’t presume that someone is not a “real” Democrat by virtue of supporting Sanders.

>. . . but when I go to your subreddits to learn what your thoughts and feelings are I see about a thousand posts and sidebars saying Pizzagate is real, that Seth Rich was murdered by the DNC, not to mention the non-stop attacks on other candidates..not just attacks on their policies, but attacks on their gender, their sexuality, their race, etc.

>It's hard to take you people seriously when this is the face you show to the world.

I understand your anger and frustration. I agree with it. Attacks based on gender, sexuality, and race should never be tolerated. As I’ve said before, I suspect that some of these are trolls, but I know that’s not all of them. 

But, what you’re doing is conflating moderates with extremists. Sadly, just like you seem to assume that most-if-not-all Sanders-supporters are lunatics, many Sanders-supporters tend to conflate “mainstream” Democrats with the people who post on r/Enough_Sanders_Spam. Just like there are people who look for reasons to hate mainstream Democrats, there are those who look for reasons to hate Sanders-supporters. If we can all learn to respect one another’s personal policy positions and candidate preferences, the extremists on both sides would start to lose power.
280.) Not much to talk about. Sanders fans will go as low and dirty as they can. 

The shit they pulled on Warren with her DNA rest shocked me. 

They're going to need votes from other candidates if they are going to win. They're more than happy to burn bridges for a 5 minute gain.
281.) Knew who it was before I even clicked it. This guy is worth looking at. He had brought to Washington State the stuff other candidates dream of doing. He is one of the few who has actually done the things he talks about.
282.) Amazingly a drop of only 3%. Showing that most people could not be swayed by anything. Even if he shot someone on Fifth Ave. Very sad to say the least.
283.) Memory is short. It'll pop back up, especially with repeated bolstering by his fanclub.

294.) He's doing exactly what Trump hired him to do.

No surprise from me.......
295.) He should RESIGN!!!
296.) He wrote a 19 page resume saying he would do just that.
297.) Miller looked like a fucking robot standing there, I literally watched to see if he blinked. That guy scares me a bit.
298.) "Legal experts"

The Republican machine is *finally* turning on him. Or are they just hedging bets?
301.) I think he did a good job with the report. It was his job to determine if the evidence was enough to prosecute obstruction of justice beyond a reasonable doubt. He couldn’t recommend it. It’s time to move on from this.
302.) Eh.
303.) is anyone REALLY surprised? slow news day, i suppose.
304.) 🤔
305.) Why wouldn’t they want a smarter gun to exist? This doesn’t make sense to me.
306.) “It’s time to militarize the populations of the world in a global effort to prevent our own destruction” 
I’m not sure that I agree with this part. What do you mean exactly?
307.) This is pretty much exactly how the first world war started... former leader just decides to stop leading and everyone starts to jockey for new leadership. 

Nature abhors a vaccum and it's unlikely everyone will just agree to go in the same direction.
308.) Excellent thoughts and comment. Excellent.
309.) Well of course it doesn't?  The "full" story is going to necessarily be classified for quite some time.  

I mean, unless we care more about the world knowing the "full" story than we do about actually countering their actions.  I know which one I care more about.
310.) The report is fairly clear that Trump did obstruct several times and attempted to obstruct multiple times to cover various violations.  

The report doesn’t clearly show whether Trump colluded with Russia. The reason for this is not because Trump’s innocent of that, it’s because the Russia investigation is still ongoing with various agencies besides the FBI, which deals mostly with national criminal investigations, and likely includes multiple agencies such as the CIA, NSA, DOD and DHS and probably more. As a result much of the Russia collusion and Russian interference is redacted from Mueller’s report.
311.) Mueller confirming what everyone knows.
312.) Gasp! Say it ain't so!
313.) Trump is projection personified
314.) Why is this even news?
315.) Sounds like trumpty, to make up stuff to get pissed off at... except again, nobody was fooled but him.
316.) The sky is blue, rocks are hard, dog run fast
317.) “Well I could have told you that...” -Uncle Rico
318.) No surprise there
319.) Obviously just an autocorrect mistake or something. At least he deleted it.
320.) I hope someone told him this doesn’t work with a Nuclear Launch 🚀 it seem he acts first without thought then thinks “ Oh shit I am Fucked”.
321.) Clickbait. Wants to wait until people testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee.

If he is still going to play "on the fence" after that, it's time to find a primary challenger.
322.) FiveWhiteGuys

Seth Moulton and 
#Tim Ryan are leading an effort to defeat Nancy Pelosi's bid for Speaker, but they don't seem to be able to offer a viable alternative.
323.) Just because he didn’t do what Trump asked doesn’t mean Don McGahn isn’t a total cunt either, because he knew Trump was committing crimes but just hung in there, tried to burnish his fucking resume and never blew the whistle. Fuck Don McGahn. He’s a lawyer and no dummy, and he knew better. That makes him the worst person in the WH not named Trump or Kushner IMO.
324.) I agreed wholeheartedly. At the very least he's guilty of conspiracy. There's no reason why he should not be put up for impeachment now. Just based on the redacted report. Imagine what the unredacted report will suggest (as far as criminal charges).

&#x200B;

326.) It’s heartening to see that more and more Dems in the field are calling for impeachment. Warren is leading the charge, and I liked that Inslee first was first on the side of voting out to vote out the toxic culture of Trumpism, but is shifting as “new” evidence makes that solution too benign.
327.) We could probably use a megathread for candidate positions on impeachment, at this point.
328.) Morally and ethically it only makes sense to draft articles of impeachment.  People can say what they want about politically what it means, but I've found that when you do the right thing as much as possible, the cards fall in your favor.
329.) So far all I know about Pete is his dislike for pence and trump, admiral qualities for sure, I look forward to learning his positions when he gets around to putting it in writing. Guess I'll have to wait for him to figure out what his donors want, it is a pragmatic if old guard approach.
330.) I think mayor Pete should focus on his city with problems, rather than try to run for president. But that’s just me prolly.
331.) Impeachment at this stage is incredibly short sighted, and I'm surprised PB would say this. The bar should be raised after the Clinton bullshit impeachment, not lowered.
332.) Oh my god what a brave soul he wants the Donald to be impeached.

>The RNC ended the month with $33.1 million cash on hand. It has raised close to $46 million this year, a staggering sum compared to the Democratic National Committee, which has not yet released its fundraising totals for the month of March but had raised $12.7 million as of the end of February. The Trump campaign announced earlier this week it had stockpiled $40 million, adding to Republicans’ campaign war chest as Democrats instead enter a months-long primary election.
334.) This man belongs in jail.  If he wasn't threatening democrats he would be going after his neighbors.  So give him a nice long prison sentence.
335.) We can thank right wing politicians and #DonTheCon for that

Really?
337.) I mean. I'm conservative and tend to vote Republican.  I'd imagine most of Republicans are also happy this guy is caught.
338.) But But her emails!!!
339.) 126 million people consumed Russia propaganda.  Sean Hannity, KellyAnn Conway, DJTJr, all retweeted Russia propaganda., according to Mueller.  The report makes it very clear that evidence was either encrypted, deleted, or worse, in the hands of the Russians.  Hillary lost due to a few counties in very few states.   Will we ever be able to say definitively either way?  No.  Were they influencers?  Hell yeah.

347.) Arrest them; press every possible charge.

356.) Crenshaw claims Serra is “highly dishonest”, in terms of his comments and association with Rose.  It’s the pot and kettle all over again... sounds just like Donnie, doesn’t it?
357.) Delusion has no bounds ...
358.) He’s a Trump clone, just another Narcissistic horror show waiting to happen.
359.) This is not a political question at this point. It is a requirement if the constitution means anything. Democrats have to stop playing politics on this. It will cost them 2020 if they treat this like a political calculation.
360.) It's so late in the game that it's almost pointless. Elections are in 2020, and while Trump is running, we have no idea what his odds of winning are yet, though the backlash to his failures to deliver, and the tax scam reaction are not in his favor. 

Either way, at best, it's a hail mary that getting Senate members to take a position will affect elections. Yes, it could motivate people to vote them out IF they're sick of Trump and the Senate's compliance with him. OR it could backfire, and lose us House AND Senate seats, which we need more than we need a Democrat president in 2020. The courts are already stacked. We need legal power.

It would be the ultimate limp noodle look if an investigation carried into 2020 and Trump isn't still president. Even worse, if it loses us votes we'll be in even worse shape.
361.) Good by her.
362.) I'm glad to see someone is trying to do what's right instead of solely focusing on what's politically convenient
363.) Buttigieg also called for impeachment
364.) Who cares. i want congressman to follow!
365.) No, other candidates will not follow.  Because it’s stupid.  What’s your plan?  Another 2 year investigation?  How about win an election? If the Democrats can’t beat Trump, they should quit.
366.) My hero
367.) Is it certain now that he hasn't?  There are 12 investigations we didn't know anything about, and a handful of sealed indictments that may/may not be related to Mueller.

In any case I'm pretty confident that SDNY will nail him to the wall.
368.) This is my theory. Mueller didn't want to indict Jr. until NY closed its loophole where a person cannot be tried on a state level if they are already being tried on a federal level. 45 could pardon his son from federal charges, assuming he was willing to plead guilty, and then he'd be off scot free. Once NY fixes its loophole, he will be indicted and tried in NY if not on federal charges.
369.) Mueller plainly laid out all the evidence that they found, talked about what was lost due to encryption/destruction, explicitly refused to exonerate Trump, and clearly called for Congress to take the next steps...
370.) It's not a mystery at all, Mueller spells it out plainly and literally: DOJ guidelines hold that he can't indict a sitting President and Mueller chose to play everything by the book.

It's up to the House to start impeachment proceedings so we can get a fuller picture and remove the President on the basis of criminal activity. By not indicting himself, Mueller also *explicitly* noted that Trump could be prosecuted if out of office in the next few years.

Tell Steny Hoyer to shut his mouth and for Democrats to not softball a criminal President as if it's just a campaign advantage. Maybe pass the message to Pelosi as well.

[Edit: I read the headline as Trump not Jr, whoops]
371.) Indicting a president is not just a legal move, but a political one. Mueller, understandably, did not want to tread into that territory. His report is unbiased and neutral, it's up to congress to interpret the report and hold the president accountable.
372.) It's no mystery, everything has to be framed in such a way to prevent Trump from pardoning Jr. Muller gathered and consolidated information for other organizations to act and right now, the GOP are currently going to try and stonewall legal action against them, burry evidence, claim ignorance, misdirect and scapegoat. 



They have no idea the full extent of Mueller's findings or what other organizations more have against them. They know Putin has dirt that might flip their voters against them, but now they have to decide against America or Putin. 



It's likely why we saw and are seeing so many Republicans have been jumping ship. Either Trump is to criminal for their comfort or they have been caught and are protected their own asses. They saw the indictments, they are well aware of Cohen's material, they know Trump is compromised. 



Putin and Trump waged war against the FBI, CIA, NSA, the highest GDP States and allied powers. Every protest dwarfs right wing gatherings. Every violent act another right winger does and is imprisoned for is an example. The calling of white supremacists terrorist eats away at their support. Their inability to field a functional city that can compare to liberal cities is a real world indicator that Conservitism, doesn't, work.
373.) It’s not a mystery at all. The DOJ subscribes to the Unitary Executive Theory, the president can not commit a crime.
374.) Because he's a republican
375.) Mueller, unlike trump and the GOP, still respects rule of law and the judicial system. It is not his place to indict him. Unless trump is implicated in one of the sealed indictments (which could be wasted if mueller overreached), he is wise not to pursue an indictment without congress making the first moves.
376.) Correct me if I’m wrong, but mueller effectively said his job was to collect the evidence and the rest of the government to do with it what they will
377.) I’m no expert. And correct me if I’m wrong. Would Mueller indict for crimes outside of the scope of his investigation? I would assume yes, but would it be possible that this evidence would just be passed onto investigators whose purview is DT Jr.?
378.) It's not really a mystery, it's says in the report that there was no evidence of a direct agreement between the two parties for coordination. The July 9th meeting shows that they tried to get information, but prosecutors can't prove that a deal between the two parties was actually made which is the final piece to establish conspiracy. A lot of information had been deleted or withheld due to Fifth Amendment protections though, so a smoking gun could have existed but they were not able to obtain it.
379.) Because he would have been almost instantaneously pardoned.
380.) I think he felt sorry for him because he’s so fucking stupid.
381.) So Don jr. was too much of a dullard to indict?
382.) If Jr. was indicted The potus would then pardon his son. 
Nobody wants to see that happen.
383.) I thought it was bc he was too stupid to understand if he committed a crime or not?
384.) [removed]
385.) Yep, as he was screaming I love Wikileaks and witch hunts...
386.) Lol... why didn't they want this "ditzy bartender" (as the right calls her) to come? Lol

Apparently they're afraid she's "smarter" than the coal miners?

391.) Somewhere Bill Clinton is watching all this and chuckling.
392.) I was a 12yo in 1994 when I enrolled into a free calligraphy class at a Bronx Community Center.  Giuliani cut funding and therefore my course got cancelled.  I sent him angry mail (with samples of calligraphy 😂) and got no reply.  I am now nearly 38, live far away from The Bronx, and I still hold this grudge.  

I can’t wait for him to FINALLY fall into obscurity.  

PS RG is a Bronx joke! (he Married his cuz in St Philip Neri church).  So happy Yankee Stadium booed him for his bday!!!
393.) What do you expect from immoral dropped on its head Rudy
394.) And Mitt can put it all behind now and move on, he's done here.
395.) All these republicans do is put out meaningless statements and move on to aiding and abetting
396.) He should also be sickened by his party and himself
397.) He may be sickened but he’s done his part to support Trumpy. Fuck him. He’s a two faced bitch.
398.) He is so sickened he will do nothing.
399.) I have a different question under this scenario.

If there was zero collusion on the Russian's proven interference with out election, how come Trump has done zero to punish them and zero to assure such blatant attacks on out country do not happen again?
400.) [removed]
401.) Why ANYONE would put this lying sack of shit on the air is beyond me.     STOP GIVING HER AIR TIME

405.) She’s going to lie wether you’re there or not, don’t go why waist your time.

411.) is this what you chodes were waiting for
412.) Please keep those applications coming in :)
413.) Let’s be clear - not all Trump supporters are racists, but all racists are Trump supporters.
414.) I feel stupid. What is a dog whistle?
415.) Saw a video today of a guy named "Mr. obvious" where he proceeds to say Honkler is a meme that triggers the "NPCs and SJWs" saying that it only looks racist because they made it so. 

And of course he doesn't mention 4chan convos where they explicitly say that it is in fact a bigoted meme.
416.) My friend who I'll just call uncle ruckus put this as his profile pic so I sent this meme to him
417.) These fucking Nazis keep taking discord emotes I like and turning them into dog-whistles. Stop turning my frog into a fascist.
418.) This meme is such an obvious dog whistle. My friend sent it to me and said he was dying. I don't find what's so amusing about it.
419.) I haven’t seen this meme yet and honestly don’t even know what search terms to put in for it on know your meme or whatever. Anybody got a quick summary?
420.) There are no depths the pretzel brains won't stoop to.
421.) For someone confused look up "Clown_World" on reddit. It's an alt right subreddit that has a bunch of these memes.
422.) I’m late to the clown thing what’s this new meme of theirs
423.) Is there any way to be alt-right and not subscribe to white supremacy? Richard Spencer's worldview center around the "white genocide" myth.
424.) I never understood this. How is the clown racist? What is the story behind it?
425.) Is it just me, or does anyone else find it strange that not a single person in the Aryan Brotherhood picture is an Aryan?
426.) Why is literally every member of the alt right the ugliest batch of fuckers I’ve ever seen?
427.) And yet Fox News refuses to call these people terrorists.
428.) aNd WhO sAyS wHiTe PeOpLe DoNt HaVe CuLtUrE

>PASCO COUNTY, Fla. - Investigators seized 110 illegal weapons, including a rocket launcher and two functional pipe bombs and several pounds of drugs, and indicted 39 members or associates of Florida white supremacist gangs, the U.S. attorney’s office said Thursday.

>The three-year investigation, dubbed “Operation Blackjack,” snared members of the Unforgiven and United Aryan Brotherhood gangs, WFTS reported.

>Those indicted range in age from 24 to 48 and were facing various charges, including possessing firearms and pipe bombs and possession and distribution of heroin and meth, WTSP reported.


>“You know, these are one of those very proud moments we have," Pasco County Sheriff Chris told WFTS. “It’s scary when you look over that table and you see those guns and they are in the hands of felons."
The suspects are facing two years to life in prison, WFTS reported. Some indictments have already led to convictions and sentences of up to 10 years, WTSP reported.
431.) Of course they got their tee-shirt tucked in their jeans. Never trust someone under 60 that tucks tshirts in.
432.) Maybe we should be building that wall along the Mason-Dixon line.
433.) As a woman I can't imagine being a Neo Nazi or supportive/sympathetic of the movement whatsoever. It is a movement that only believes my place is in the kitchen and producing white children. I know of pickmes but this is... really bizarre to see honestly
434.) "has become"?
435.) A ROCKET LAUNCHER?!?!
436.) It'll take bastards like these attacking cops or military before the government picks its boots up and goes zero tolerance on these clowns.
437.) You won't find one of these fucks that isn't a gigantic sack of shit.

Which explains their love for Donald Trump.

And his love for them.
438.) What the fuck is that flag behind them? It looks like a mini Confederate flag stitched onto..... the French flag?

I guess they just wanted to remember their heritage of surrendering to everyone else.
439.) A rocket launcher
440.) r/beholdthemasterrace
441.) Hitler would have taken one look at this crew and sent them off on a train.
442.) And hear I was thinking this photo was from a The_Dumpster get together! Silly me!
443.) Dude on the left looks like the evil wizard from Avengers infinity Wars
444.) Wow this is actually true
445.) Are they really putting a swastika on an American flag? 

And these people are not in jail?

Those who don’t learn the lessons of the past are doomed to repeat it.

Fix education
446.) But, but, how else are they supposed to protect themselves from the violent libruls and scary brown people who talk all funny-like?! /s
447.) Hell, I just see a group of Trump voters in the photo.
448.) So tired of republican extremists
449.) Become?
450.) Trunp: Just a ''few good folks.'' With guns, on meth, doin the loards werk.
451.) I suspect that they don't vote.
452.) [removed]
453.) Good
454.) That's not Aryan Brotherhood. Aryan Brotherhood is a notoriously violent criminal gang. These are just racist dorks when would be murdered by said violent criminal outfit.
455.) You mean there's more than one bad guy?
456.) Got a nagging feeling that Fox News never mentioned this story, probably spent the whole day complaining about AOC or Ilhan Omar for one reason or another.
457.) Where are the tall, fit blonde men with rippling muscles and strong, obedient blonde women with perfect genes?

&#x200B;

How did it come to steroid monkeys, balding fatsos, inbred families with a collective IQ of 2 digits and scrawny dudes with asthma to uphold the "purity" of the Aryan race?

&#x200B;

Oh yeah because neonazis would be the grunts and brainless goons in a regime where people with education and social grace run the show, and those people fucking despise you for the septic waste neonazis are.

Closer to terrorist group than support group
467.) The old paraphrased saying goes "If ten people are at a table with a Nazi and not punching him actively and repeatedly, the table has 10 Nazis".
468.) Don't forget, over 60,000,000 of your fellow citizens voted for this fucktard.  

And they STILL support him.

So who's the bigger idiot?
469.) Wow what a complete moron. He does realize that not how shit works down there right? 2020 can not come fast enough.
470.) If this is true, what are the details?  Were US Soldiers on Mexican land?
471.) Lies
472.) I believe we're already in a civil war without realizing it.

A war with Mexico would only change the administration's cold war stance on Mexico to a hot war. 

This administration destroys Mexico's economy with every lying tweet. This administration has abused asylum seekers. Just think about that. If America fell into chaos and Canada treated their asylum seekers on their border the way we are now, how fucked up would that be?
473.) He thinks being criticized for being a white power advocate is like what Christ went through on the way to the cross.
474.) Yes your troubles with these controversies were similar to being nailed to a cross by your hands and feet and left to rot.
475.) This asshole literally leaves me speechless and in need of Pepto Bismal.
476.) If only
477.) If Jesus came back, Steve King would want him crucified.
478.) They're trying to make Brexit a christian issue. People like Widdecombe and Farage believe in christian sharia law. Dangerous nutcases.
479.) Old bat will be dead soon probably. Fuck her.
480.) Honestly, if this siphons votes from the Tories and UKIP I'm all for it.
481.) Is there actually any proof that the Russian government had anything to do with Brexit?  I was a Remain voter but that just seems like red scare hysteria.
482.) It's utterly not ironic that the second the last of the "Boomers" got out of college, it became illegal to file bankruptcy on student loans. I'm on the leading edge of Gen-X and we were the first to be fucked by these hypocritical assholes.
483.) The equivalent of saying a cure for cancer would be a slap in the face for everybody who has ever had cancer
484.) Since the system is set up shitty and unfair to me, it should stay shitty and unfair for everyone forever /s
485.) This thinking is idiotic, currently struggling to pay my loans but would love to see future generations not to have to go through the same shit.
486.) You know, I'd probably be a little annoyed at this point only owing like 30k left. 

But like, I'd love to have children. And I want a better world and stronger country.
487.) The emancipation of slaves was a slap in the face to all the slaves that were never freed.
488.) I for one want the economy to not be slowed down for the foreseeable future because of the massive burden of student loans, so I'll pay my 35k if everyone else can be forgiven
489.) It’s like saying that because I was in hospital with meningitis when I was one, a cure for meningitis would be slapping me in the face
490.) Goes to show you how self-centered and selfish people on the right are.
491.) Ending war would be a slap in the face to all veterans who were drafted
492.) Not surprising the supporters of a /r/PresidentWarren our far smarter than that of Trump.

495.) Maximum victim complex.
496.) What a loada bs
497.) Broflakes.
498.) Its almost like theres nothing wrong with being gay
499.) Well, because it's normal to be gay. Someone being gay does not have an affect on making people poorer etc. 

But it's not normal or well accepted to be a shitty person (Conservative) who votes for policies that literally want to harm people less fortunate than you or different from you.
500.) Lmao I love it because these guys always call people special snowflakes but they love victim status as much as anyone else. Oh those poor persecuted conservatives!
501.) "But like, just don't be gay right? I can't *choose* not to conservative."
502.) Conservatives have become the whiniest bitches in American history.
503.) Can’t stand that woman. Didn’t she vote against gay marriage etc?
504.) She’s a gammon.

506.) I saw the post that Twitterer was citing. It was them complaining that it was hamfisted and cringey, just for different reasons than he probably thought it was.
507.) How the fuck does he justify putting Nazis in the same sentence as people who are black or belong to the LGBTQ communities?
508.) r/enlightenedcentrism
509.) Former Skinheads can be remorseful and recant, but that's the only kind of beswastikaed person I can coexist with.
510.) Say it louder for the people in the back.
511.) I want to live in a world where wearing anything associated with fascism is seen as morally unforgivable... but you know 🤷‍♂️
512.) Imagine being so delusional that you believe that lgbt/black pride are on the same level as swastikas and neo Nazis
513.) "without physically attacking each other"

Guns don't count! lol
514.) I really want to believe so so badly that this is sarcasm.
515.) Another conservative scumbag.
516.) Fuck this opinion entirely
517.) "Oh, you're getting kicked in the head? Well, it'd be mighty intolerable for you to get up and fight back, now wouldn't it. So, guess you can just lay there and keep getting kicked in the head until you die."

People that think like this can fuck the hell off the planet. My grandmother was a literal Nazi. She died a lonely, bitter, hateful woman that attempted to kill herself because she had to live with her son's Jewish wife (yup, I'm Jewish by heritage, too). I hope my grandmother is rotting in the hell that she rightfully deserves, along with her brothers who were soldiers, and any fucking piece of shit that allies with any of them and their actions. They are murderers, and even casting an ounce of support their direction makes you equally guilty of every crime that they committed.

Hate speech and associating yourself with hate groups needs to be classified as incitement and bring penalties all the way up to jail time. And if your hateful words lead to the murder of someone, you need to be the one serving equal time as an accomplice to that murder.
518.) I would not want to live in that world.

Signed, someone whose ancestors died in the Holocaust
519.) What if I wear a swastika with a giant red "banned" circle and slash through it, a klansman with a giant red "banned" circle and slash through it, and some graffiti from Germany with a portrait of Hitler blowing his brains out with a pistol and the caption "Nazi Follow Your Leader"?

&#x200B;

Because I do.
520.) His twitter feed is something else. Yikes.
521.) "Real intolerance comes from the left because they discriminate against the intolerant".   
Fuck right off with that shit please and thank you. As a queer person, I have **zero** tolerance for nazi scum who believe I don't have the right to exist. Zero
522.) >physically attacking each other

Not pictured: police pepper spraying and beating the other two at a counterprotest, while allowing the Nazi to freely march.

But these enlightened centrists have a *huge* blindspot for police violence, deeming it fully acceptable to maintain their precious marketplace. Hell, they don't often even think of it too closely *as* political violence, they just call it a simple fact of life.
523.) I want to live in a world where 2 foxes and a hen can have a drink together
524.) beau of the fifth column expressed in the video that the "center" viewpoint to genocide or forcible removal of ethnicities or creeds is "no, and we will resist you with violence if you attempt to do so." - further left may be "you are in my crosshairs just for saying it" but the center is to maintain homeostasis of innocent people through the application of violent resistance.
525.) It's amazing the mental gymnastics people do. I think the vast majority of people realise co-existing and not being assholes to eachother is the right thing but instead of changing their ideology to match that they do the mental equivalent of a quad axel to frame their hate as acceptance
526.) "I wish for a return to my blissful and innocent ignorance - a world where I walked as if through a fog, never understanding what ideology is let alone politics, and so had no idea that some people try very hard to doing very bad things to broad categories of people for no real good reason. I want this so bad that I refuse to examine any of these ideas and hold all ideologies as morally identical and equivalent, because that makes perfect sense."
527.) Seems like the alt-Reich wants to turn the low road into the high road. https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/578/682/575.jpg

These people can die in a fire.
528.) The “equate gays and any other harmless group with Nazis” tactic is there so you associate both as extreme and offensive positions. 

It’s dangerous and should be called out every time. The person should be mocked and humiliated.
529.) only one of these groups is a problem.
530.) No offence but I'd rather shove a scolding hot cactus up my arse than coexist with people who hate me for being born
531.) People don't understand that Black Power isn't Black Supremacy.
532.) “I wanna be friends with arsenic.”
533.) Paradox of tolerance
534.) Lmao the whole point of nazis is to be intolerant to all non-aryans

536.) Aye.  I cannot engage in meaningful dialogue with someone who only has disingenous intent.
537.) What are Nazis famous for,  again?
538.) Maybe he meant Hindus or Buddhists wearing the original swastika symbol?

*eternal optimist*
539.) Won't someone think of the poor Nazis?!
540.) But black and gay people don't want Nazis to exist, double standard /s
541.) I want to live in a world where people can't wear Nazi symbolism without being attacked.
542.) Radical centrism
543.) Chad is one of them fine centrists.
544.) Who in fucking hell is chad felix greene anyway?
545.) The point to the centrist is that they can live a peaceful, trouble-free life as the Nazis kill everyone else.
546.) Fighting for people's rights apparentely is the same as advocating for genocide.
547.) Read as "I want to be able to wear swastikas without getting punched".
548.) Pretty sure we fought a war because a bunch of people wearing swastikas got a bit too violent.

557.) Good for them. Fuck that racist shit
558.) On one hand, racist statue. On the other hand, statue celebrating women... (very rare for that time period)
559.) Hitler called it 'lügenpresse'. The phrase means ‘lying press’ in German, and was used to attack media outlets that were deemed to be unsupportive of the Nazi party and its aims.

Unsupportive of Trump
560.) The sheer dictatorial language is fucking scary.
561.) He's going full dictator.  Awesome.
562.) Tweets at 3 in the morning
563.) LOL this reminds me of Superman 2. Kneel before Zod!

Fuck Trump the Narcissist.

570.) What a cowardly asshole.
571.) Every time I see these fucks, they’re about as far from the Nazi ideal as you can get.
572.) Weren't Nazis super into fitness? These potato motherfuckers would die before they ran a mile.
573.) They are so inbred they are in a sandwich!
574.) Honest Republicans.
575.) So this is Trump MAGA future.
576.) I feel like this also belongs on Cringe subreddit too
577.) Ahhhhh. I see you misunderstood!! It only matters if the family is white /s
578.) Trump is a father of at least five children from three marriages that he ruined by fucking, among others, porn stars, glamour models and future wives.

In the case of wife three, the last two both apply.

They don't give a shit about "familiar values". It's in the same category as "economic anxiety".
579.) That family is so white, they make that picket fence look grey. 😂
580.) Ahhh, life in a shitty cookie cutter suburb. With an unfulfilled stay at home wife who pops qualuudes while raising children who will one day have no issue watching the world burn for a few extra bucks. A world where the darkies knew their place and gays were only spoken about it hushed chastising tones. The good old days.

All jokes aside, shit like this is funny to me. You can have this provincial suburban life if you want it. I have friends who married right out of college, had kids, and now live a suburban life that wouldn’t be different at all from the one pictured. Absolutely no one stops you from doing this. 

Which leads to the crux of the post imo. Shit like this is parroted by people who cannot achieve the middle class life they wish, and they blame minorities and liberals for that fact. Or, it’s people who *know* this type of life still exists, but you would need to suffer gays on TV and a black neighbor while living it, and that’s unacceptable.
581.) Lets add worshipping a guy that has cheated in every one of his massages
582.) God, that looks boring as shit. *This* is the square-ass life they're fighting for?
583.) You know I think I’ve seen this somewhere before https://i.pinimg.com/236x/13/a0/17/13a017609f1de94c6d4d2845da397d21--nazi-propaganda-ww-posters.jpg
584.) The funniest part about this example of what they're "fighting for" is that literally no one is stopping them from buying an old 1950s house and having a couple kids. Like, go for it. I'm sure everyone on T\_D looks exactly like the dad in this picture, right?
585.)  >GILEAD NOW!
586.) TV dinner by the pool.  I'm so glad I finished school.
587.) This looks like a propaganda poster from Germany 1933
588.) The dad is probably a wife batterer behind closed doors. The wife is probably doing the guy next door. The girl will grow up and be in an abusive relationship like mommy was and the son will batter his wife like daddy did.

Also... "fighting for"... Lol. Oh, please! 😂
589.) FFS, the username. Why do these dipshits always fantasise about being Vikings?
590.) So the same country with ties to 15 terrorists involved with 9/11, the same country that murdered Jamal Khashoggi at one of its consulate, is now spreading false or anti-Mueller report information, all the while the Trump administration is giving the **'OK'** to sell Saudi Arabia nuclear power work & giving no reason why, just like when Trump backed out of the Iran Deal with zero reasons.

I'm also going to go out on a limb and say Putin and MbS BFF's, just like Trump and Putin, or Trump and MbS... what a shitshow. 😒
591.) You gotta admit Twitter's doing what they can.
592.) The deplorables don’t care.  They hate immigrants more than looking out for their own best interests.
593.) Shame on blimpo with the megaphone for not continuously waving the flag. So disrespecful to our beautiful, gorgeous, flag, it's the best flag, the best.

And I REALLY would like see the entire poster in the middle.
594.) I love it! We need more heroes like her.
595.) Thankfully bigots never have basic art or graphic design skills.
596.) The U.S. and the U.K. are partners in their mutual diminishment. It’s no exaggeration to say that neither nation’s reputation will ever recover from the Trump-Brexit era.  Their traditional allies will rightfully never trust them or the will of their citizens ever again. 

"It beggars belief that on the very same day Donald Trump is threatening to veto a United Nations resolution against the use of rape as a weapon of war, Theresa May is pressing ahead with her plans to honour him with a state visit to the UK,"
597.) Sadly this is a very popular opinion in Britain, the press constantly attacks Markle for being mixed race. Mind you royalty lovers of that ilk tend to be the most horrible xenophobic cretins this country offers.
598.) His surname sounds Polish.

Why are they so many Polish neo-Nazis? Hitler wanted you guys **dead**.
599.) And here I thought they weren't cultured enough to know what a Broadway play was! (or at least that they would think it was to gay to watch one. I mean... They play dressup and all!).

I guess Trumpsters still can surprise me! Hopefully with enough culture they can change their ways. Bless their hearts.
600.) *sees an athlete kneel before a game*

>Just focus on the game and keep your politics out of it

*sees a performer yank a flag away from an insufferable chud at a play*

>What can men do against such reckless hate?
601.) The moderators removed my post asking if its been addressed and then proceeded to mute me from communicating with them. 

I've asked prior because they are unapologetically racist "in the name of humor" but when coupled with one of the host's nazi tattoo...if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck
602.) I'm not normally a fan of the death penalty but in the case of white supremacists...
603.) Awesome! I saw he was outed a little while ago, glad he's been fired!
604.) That’s two-faced.
605.) \-Republicans are pretty much shit people.

\-Nuh uh.  Some bad apples just ruined the bunch.

\-Your dude just said rape was the will of god.  That's not just some guy.  That's *the* guy in Oaklahoma.  *The* guy.  Between him and Steve King, how do you want me to feel about Republicans?
606.) Yeah, only a rapist would worship a god that willed rape.
607.) Rapists are doing God’s work. That’s a new one*. 

*or not. There’s probably a bunch of these guys who have said shit like that and it just didn’t make it into the paper.
608.) Why aren't abortions, then?
609.) [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/oklahoma-representative-god/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/oklahoma-representative-god/)


Edit: how the fuck did this get silver?
610.) BuT IMmigrants ArE a BuNCh of Rapist
611.) Republican logic: It’s only the will of God is the rapist is a white Christian.  If it’s a Muslim, Mexican, or black man then it’s not the will of God, the rapist should be put to death, and it’s something that embedded within that rapists culture/religion and that’s why the US shouldn’t let these people in
612.) Does that also apply to former congressmen in prison?  Bend over and spread 'em Okie douche nozzle.
613.) “obviously if it happens in someone’s life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, you know, but – So you’re saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone’s life”

If you say rape is “not the best thing” you are completely out of touch with reality. The lack of empathy from these types is outstanding.
614.) When I first saw this headline, I thought “no way this is real, my standards are low but that’s just insane”

[Well, I’m disappointed with the results](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/oklahoma-representative-god/). 

tl;dr: snopes rated the headline “mostly true”
615.) Sounds like a confession to me.
616.) All Republicans are terrible.
617.) the representative from Gilead.
618.) I’ve travelled all over America, Oklahoma was one of the most terrifying places I ever visited
619.) The fact these types of guys get voted into office prove it’s not just them it’s the majority of republicans who are shit
620.) "Christian Sharia law." Well, both him and the article's author seem to have a Republican's view of Islam.
621.) Does this mean miscarriages are God's abortions?
622.) I thought his name was Christian Sharia for a whole five seconds
623.) Rape is illegal in Shariah Law...
624.) I love the use of “Christian Sharia Law.” They rail against Muslims for wanted religious laws that supersede the Constitution while simultaneously pushing for their own version. I hope this catches on.
625.) Can we arrest god now
626.) [removed]
627.) So abortions are also gods will?
628.) I would love to punch him in his stupid face and say that was “the will of god”.
629.) I hope he gets hit by a car 😊
630.) A two year-old screenshot.... there's so much fucked up stuff going on right \*now,\* y'all.
631.) Man I sure do love living in Oklahoma /s
632.) I grew up in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is a good place to be from...far away from. I still pull for the Sooners but that could be a sign of my own personal flaw(s).
633.) The Christian Taliban strikes again.
634.) When you take this in along with the fact that the same people endorsing rape also want to outlaw abortion, and then you see the horrific connection between the two...
635.) Wait wait wait, Oklahoma is implementing sharia law?
636.) So according to Trump’s logic Mexico is sending citizens who act under the will of god to America? Lol
637.) Then god is evil and must be opposed at all costs.

Also, I noticed a lot of people in the comments are debating over whether his statement was misunderstood. Really? When sexual abuse is brought up a lot of people suddenly become sceptics, it seems. Interesting.
638.) Fuck Republicans.
639.) I can't believe I share a planet with this scum.
640.) I wonder if he’d feel that way if he were ass-raped by a stronger man?
641.) Douche
642.) I wonder what his wife, daughter(s), sister(s), or mother has to say about this.

Edit: It’s always men who push this horse shit.  We need to push very hard for stuff like Texas House Bill 4260. Yes, it’s insane. Something needs to be done to shine the spotlight on this dog whistling. 

[Texas House Bill 4260](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB04260I.htm) 

>”Sec. 173.009.  SONOGRAM ELECTION. 
An attending physician must administer a **medically-unnecessary** digital rectal exam and magnetic resonance imagining of the rectum before administering an elective vasectomy or colonoscopy procedure, or prescribing Viagra. This digital rectal exam and rectal sonogram must take place during the initial health care consultation before an elective vasectomy is performed, a prescription is given for Viagra, or a colonoscopy is performed.”

>”Sec. 173.010. FINES RELATED TO MASTURBATORY EMISSIONS.
 	Masturbatory emissions created in health or medical facilities will be stored for the purposes of conception for a current or future wife.”

>”(a)  Emissions outside of a woman's vagina, or created outside of a health or medical facility, will be charged a $100 civil penalty for each emission, and will be considered an act against an unborn child, and failing to preserve the sanctity of life.”
643.) Doing Oklahoma proud /s
644.) Sounds like something a rapist who hasn't been caught might say.
645.) "DEUS VULT"
646.) Somehow, I think he would change his mind if it happened to him.... maybe....
647.) Shockingly sad.
648.) That looks a lot like Brian Regan and I was scared for a sec cause I love Brian Regan.
649.) I'm betting he'll change his tune if anything bad happens to him though...
650.) I'm sure hes garbage and everything, but did he actually say that?  like "Rape is just the will of God being enacted"  or did he say something like "Everything is part of God's plan" and we are just assuming that that also de facto includes rape?
651.) Democrats have become Republicans and Republicans have become bat-shit crazy.  What does it mean when comedians are the social conscience of a society?  The Ukraine just elected a comedian - and most of the people I know would vote for Jon Stewart in a heart beat.
652.) Under his eye.
653.) I thought this was Babylon Bee for a second. Was disappointed.
654.) Mostly true:

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/oklahoma-representative-god/
655.) Can someone post the full article?
656.) Absolute scum of the earth.

Fuck religion and all of it's cancer
657.) Remember during the Obama years how it seemed that a republican would say something terrible about rape every few months? When republicans retake the house in a post-Trump red wave there will be GOP politicians making Holocaust denial comments every few months.
658.) Hearing these fucked up words inspired by their rage-filled lie-topia of an existence used to piss me off, now I'm all for it and want them to become more unhinged so that even the still-complacent among us see this and are motivated to vote these sick fucks out. Sadly, for too many, it has to get to a terrible place for them to jump into action to make it better.

665.) I'm conservative and this is terrible. There are plenty of old bucks left in the Republican party that might say something like this but the clouds are moving and a younger group of more principled conservatives are coming up. They tend to be economically conservative and open to new ideas. It appears, from where I stand, that there is an emerging Republican party that will one day respect LGBT persons as equals and can challenge political ideas on their merits rather than seeing liberals as other than themselves.

[https://heavy.com/news/2019/04/joey-derek-christian/](https://heavy.com/news/2019/04/joey-derek-christian/)

Its too tragic to be funny that a fellow with an attitude and prison record like that thinks that some other dude who is working and paying taxes is the reason the country is in the shit.

And what is with all these white superior pride types that are the absolute worst examples of 'white humanity' somehow thinking they are better than others?
677.) What a giant piece of shit
678.) The extremist right.....aka a violent Trumplikan.
679.) I often wonder how these conversations start
680.) He's not even a veteran, so add stolen valor to the list.
681.) Fucking dickhead.

I fucking hate this mentality of "I am/was a soldier, RESPECT ME!!!"

Some soldiers do disgusting terrible things while at war, including raping women etc. (Obviously I don't mean ALL are dickheads). 

If he even truly is a veteran. Fuck this piece of slimey dog shit.
682.) In Nintendo’s defense, if they left it in but blocked, say, nazi flags, idiots would call them sjwtards and hypocritical, despite the fact that thi would’ve been the first slightly political thing Nintendo would’ve done that I can remember
683.) Of course he is. He is continually going after the most vulnerable members of society.

He is going after those who he thinks don't have a voice.
684.) He really is a cruel, heartless son of a bitch.
685.) He won’t be happy until all trans people are dead. Evil motherfucker.
686.) The big problem with the Ken Burns series was the constant use of that Lost Causer Shelby Foote. I would recommend anyone watching that series on Netflix to skip past him whenever he starts blabbing his pro-South nonsense.

688.) Whoops! That apostrophe is in the wrong place.
689.) What a douche

692.) Didn't it turn out that the reported student was a citizen, and this boy had to go into 'hiding' because the school was receiving threats because of his bigoted actions?
693.) Oh my god, how stupid could they be? They're literally standing there with merlons on either side of them, and they can't see the difference between the Great Wall of China and Trump's proposed border fence. Because that's what it is, a glorified fence. It's not something you can stand on and snipe enemy bandits from, not that you should be doing that on the US border anyway.

Either that or they're trolling us, but if they are, then well done, couple; you've only served to prove that you're not worth listening to.

704.) This is one of the most despicable crimes ive ever known of.
705.) Fry the prick
706.) GOOD.
707.) I was 8 when this happened and lived in Houston so seeing this was a very unpleasant blast from the past. It was all over down there, every TV station and the newspaper talked about it for weeks. I'm really surprised he hadn't been executed yet. In fact, I thought he already had been executed.
708.) Hmmm... And Trump and McConnell aren't enablers... Yeah, ok...
709.) Is it just me, or is the ALT-right using the 'right to start a Militia' as excuse to wave guns around wherever, whenever, and at whoever because things aren't going their way? 


Kinda like when they try to use 'religious freedom' as an excuse to try and discriminate against who ever they want, then throws a hissy fit and claim **they're** being discriminated against because it didn't work.
710.) He looks fit and ready for war.
711.) This is the kind of insanity that happens when you have an idiot in chief, that rallies his troops with propaganda and hate.
712.) Oh so that's why the government got off their asses.
713.) He's not a militia leader he's a leader or a terrorist organization. Militia implies legitimacy and perhaps even constitutional legality.
714.) They’re delusional.
715.) Probably because we don’t drink the Kool-Aid
716.) Because they lead miserable lives and like to blame others for their own problems in life.
717.) They’re inherently angry.
718.) They were under the impression that there would be participation trophies

I feel like there are not many more steps between what's now and creating any sort of cover up until it's not necessary to cover up.  People think I'm paranoid.

I haven't read this article and just skimmed through it, but it claims that the BJS (Bureau of Justice Statics) claims more than 200,000 prisoners are the victims of sexual assault:  [https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/07/25/prison-rape-allegations-are-on-the-rise](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/07/25/prison-rape-allegations-are-on-the-rise)

Those are grown men and in prison, predominately, but to think of how many of these things happen because of guards, to think that there are children involved, to think that although there is a very low percentage of these migrants that may be people who would sexually abuse someone but that they likely are not being sent through the proper channels and so any victims would likely go unheard, is pretty ghastly.  There are a lot of chances for shitty things to happen to people who may not speak English or be old enough to represent themselves in any meaningful way.
723.) What a despicable piece of shit...
724.) I hate this racist prick.

He creeps me out more than Trump does.

742.) It must be quite the burden to be that stupid..
743.) Thinking that white straight Christian males are being oppressed requires not only a mind so stupid it is impossible to fathom, it requires outright lies on top of it.

I don't know the provenance of the original meme, but it smells of borscht to me.
744.) Right wingers: Corporations should be deregulated, except when I want them to promote my religion, which is also the largest in the world.

748.) Obama was far from perfect, but he is still a thousand times better a person than the Orange nightmare.
749.) One of these sounds presidential, the other sounds like your uncle's Facebook post.
750.) To be fair, Trump did tweet about Sri Lanka... he said there were 138 million that died...
751.) Probably just learned that lower unemployment rate is better, so had to show off this newly found knowledge in a tweet.
752.) It just speaks to the basic way their brains work.  They are polar opposites.

With all the things going on today, easter holiday, bombings in sri lanka and all the regular worrys trumps only thought is to brag about money.

Obama (being a decent human being) has concerns and hope for everybody.

EDIT:  Obama wasn't perfect but holy fuck the country was better off...
753.) Trump translation: everything is about me

Obama translation:  lets think about others.

I sincerely wonder Trump and many of his followers understand the concepts of compassion and empathy.  It’s a given that many of them don’t know what the words mean, but do they experience compassion and empathy?
754.) I feel like twitter needs mood avatars.  The text is a little off next to a beaming Barack.  Much like Donald's pic needs to be him making the face he made when he disgustingly made fun of disabled people.
755.) I agree with the sentiment, but he did tweet about Sri lanka too today.
756.) Well said, Obama. And fuck Donald Dump.

840.) There aren't 138 million people in Sri Lanka you fool!
841.) I love how they try to paint Islam as a political ideology instead of a religion, when the GOP is the party of people who want Christian religious law.
842.) Meanwhile the Tamil Tigers are the only ones I have seen in the news
843.) Waiting for the "Christians" who cry, "FALSE FLAG" about every other attack to start up...

... Any minute now...

... Still waiting...
844.) Do these people ever actually watch the news?
845.) Are Muslims considered the left?
846.) And...nothing has happened. Turns out that being a racist truly doesn't grant you any precognition. In fact, I'd say their predictions for the future are the opposite of what is actually happening. Islam is the fastest growing religion and Muslims operate thousands of organizations for non violence, peace, relief aid and many others. We're thriving. No true Muslim ever commits violence against another human being. " Whoever kills an innocent person it is as though he has killed all mankind, And whoever saves a life it is as though he had saved all mankind." Actual quote from the Quran. If you want to throw stones in your glass house, let me also point out that Muslims never engaged in mass colonialism, slavery, crusades, genocide and imperialism like the west did, leading to the deaths of billions. Yet the west claims they are the moral authority? Terrorism is not Islam, there is nothing further from Islam.  No terrorist has ever been a Muslim because no true Muslim would commit such awful acts. Your Muslim ban only hurts innocent families. Migration is a human right, Trump is stands against human rights.
847.) >Deplorable Lives Matter

I bloody hate how they have adopted “deplorable” as a term of endearment. It’s so cringeworthy.
848.) This guys such a winner... Hell he may not even know what deplorable means? I'm thinking he's not the sharpest tool in the tool box.
849.) Get a new toner cartridge, ya fuckin tool.
850.) It's great that the leader of this cult was arrested but all of these militia members should be arrested!
851.) What's horrible is that little kids are watching his show and being indoctrinated.
852.) Another foreigner polluting American society with its un-American extremist filth. YouTube needs to cut that little Swede pissant’s hate speech from its platform.
853.) This was a really well put-together and informative video. I think the vast majority of these alt-right, white nationalists are just lost boys and girls who found something to grip on to and make themselves feel special, where, without it, they would just be in a self-hating depressive state. The monologue given by the lad near the end who describes how he got sucked into it is such an eye-opener into how some of these people ended up this way. He was told his problems could be attributed to immigrants, or lack of societal values or whatever, rather than himself, so he plunged down that rabbit hole, as he put it as such.

Of course, some of them are probably legitimate psychopaths who get hard at the thought of jack-booted oppression and power tripping, but I think they are the minority.

Problem is if you go too far down the rabbit hole, and it takes root as your identity, trying to claw someone back out of that would be nearly impossible. Their whole sense of self worth and purpose is built around the ideology, like a cult.
854.) [removed]
855.) Apparently these Russians don’t care if their info comes from college dropouts who don’t have a degree in journalism the same as the Trump Klan doesn’t seem to care here in America.
856.) They're just trying to get they're money's worth. They've invested so much.

>"My mother has been filing lots of demands for disciplinary actions against lawyers, incited by right-wing blogs. I don't know what to do..."  
>  
>It was last summer that I received this message from an office worker in his 40s. After speaking several times over the phone, I met him directly and heard his story.  
>  
>His mother, in her mid-60s, worked at a local government office until she retired a few years ago. At that time, it was said that she was a very normal, calm "working woman". She divorced about 10 years ago, and lives alone at home.  
>  
>"She had no hobbies in particular, and after retirement, she became homebound. It may be that she became addicted to the internet to deal with her loneliness."  
>  
>On the internet, she encountered the popular right-wing blog “Three-year lifespan current affairs diary”. He then started to notice changes in his mother.  
>  
>"Sometimes when I went back to my mother's home, she was watching TV and muttered 'this Korean ...' or something anti-Korean. I was worried because I had never heard her use language like that before. "  
>  
>Last time, I wrote that about 1,000 senior citizens were filing demands for disciplinary actions against lawyers who were complete strangers, incited by right-wing blogs. Some of the lawyers caught up in these demands have sued the senior citizens for damages, and television and newspapers have started to report on these mass filings of demands for disciplinary actions.  
>  
>Her son had a bad feeling. "No way, is my mother really ...?!". When he returned to his mother's home after a long time, there were piles of receipts of demands for disciplinary actions on the table. He counted nearly 150 receipts. The mother had already filed demands for disciplinary actions against nearly 150 lawyers.  
>  
>This can be said to be a typical case of a senior citizen filing demands for disciplinary actions against lawyers. When living alone, there is no one to talk to. There is plenty of time to spend on the computer. By reading the right-wing blogs every day, they become convinced that there is a "truth" that the mainstream media never tells them. Because there is no one else living at home, no one becomes suspicious about the large amount of receipts that arrive from the Bar Association. His mother insists, "We are fighting for Japan!" "If we don't do it, then they'll do it to us!" and she won't lend her ear to any efforts at persuading her otherwise. Even when they explain to her that, if she is sued by a lawyer and she loses, she will have to pay a large sum in damages, she is not dissuaded, insisting that "we will fight even if this house has to be sold".  
>  
>He is worried about what would happen if his company learned about this situation. I was sorry to hear his story, but I could not do anything. I've been keeping in touch with him since, but the situation is not changing at all.

858.) Well, now I'm imagining ISIS comprised soley of elderly women in bifocals trying to load machine guns. I think that this is perhaps the way the Republicans are going to thin out the Social Security recipients.
859.) Good for her.
860.) And nothing of value was lost.

865.) It’s a good thing no people were harmed in this article.
866.) Someone give that lady a medal.
867.) Why, Roosh? Because he was a hack who profited off of insecure man-babies who realized he didn't have anything useful to say once they finished cleaning their rooms.
868.) Because he never had anything of value to offer and his success was due to him being propped up by the right wing nazi media?
869.) Good.
870.) Good.
871.) Good.

Ahhh. The same John Birch Society founded by the Koch father. Like peas in a pod, these ones.
874.) This is the republican party.
875.) My surprise level with these things remains constant. By constant I mean not changing. As in has always been 0, every single time.
876.) Not on my watch goddamit....
877.) Considering white america makes up like 60% of the population I'd say it's worryingly larger than a 1/3.
878.) I don’t understand the title. Can you clarify, Walter?
879.) It makes sense if you have dementia. Believe me. Bigly.
880.) That's just the number who died when the whites colonized it. Easy mistake.
881.) Nothing will happen but I reported them to the IRS. Want to peddle Christian sharia, pay the tax man.
882.) If churches give out voting guides they should have to pay taxes
883.) Fucking political extremists posing as churches should be Fucking taxed into the fucking ground.
884.) I honestly thought that was a shaming/callout at first then i reread it and realized they were _proud_ of it
885.) [Front if anyone is curious, sorry about the flash](https://imgur.com/hBqzKCX)
886.) This is an admission that this church needs to lose its tax exempt status.
887.) And here I was, thinking "freedom" included a distinct separation of church and state.
888.) What the actual fuck?
889.) No one can deny this...
890.) Haha wait  you guys don't remember that part in the Bible where jesus meets a leper and he just pulls his nose off?
891.) Trump is losing the plot and becoming “disabled” himself so I guess he’s sowed his own seeds, so to speak.
892.) At least religious hypocrisy is now laid bare for all to see.
893.) Thanks for blurring his horrid face.

The sight and sound of him make me physically sick, for all he represents.


There's a good book called One Nation Under God.. How Corporate America Invented Christian America which details how this campaign to invent right wing Jesus started in the 50s and explains how they corrupted his teachings to excuse their immoral exploitation. They have confused the pious into supporting their oppression, the fucking charlatans.
894.) This was the exact moment that I knew he would never become president of the United States. Blatant immaturity coupled with the cruelty of a schoolyard bully.

Yeah good thing I don't place bets on election outcomes. Just wild.

Edit: a word
895.) Let’s be real, conservative Christians were never with Jesus in the first place.
896.) I've asked Christians about this and they told me it's "fake news". I then responded, "It's well-documented because it was record live".  They still say it's fake news.
897.) You should post it to r/dankchristianmemes as well.
898.) 45* has become the golden calf that the Israelites started worshiping in Moses' absence.
899.) Conservatives are domestic terrorists. Pretty sure Jesus isn't into terrorism.

910.) Getting him in your suggestions would probably make you reevaluate everything about you.
911.) Now if we could just ban him from life.
912.) Dang imagine getting matched up with this scumbag
913.) Some people may be wondering why I'm targeting Joe Rogan, someone that claims to not be alt-right and holds some liberal views. Well, the reason why is because he platforms a lot of alt-right characters along with progressives, which makes his alt-right guests seem more acceptable in the eyes of a moderate. The intention he has for hosting them is irrelevant because [his role as a useful idiot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HclaKb5LUYY) does the job in radicalizing people. If we want to get serious about stopping alt-right radicalization, we need to target its source. As Faraday Speaks [brilliantly claims in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfLa64_zLrU), people don't come up to you in Nazi uniform and tell you to join the alt-right, they slowly bring you to accept their beliefs by normalizing them and then tying them to beliefs you already hold.

Edit: To expand on my point in how moderates get radicalized, check out Christian Picciolini, a former skinhead that now fights against hatred.
914.) It’s refreshing to see others point out that Joe Rogan is a useless addition to entertainment. 

I’ve been saying it for awhile and enjoying the downvote Reddit mob reaction.
915.) He used to be semi-entertaining before he came out as a Reich wing christofascist asshole
916.) Marshall looks like such a cute pup. Shame he can’t understand that his owner is complicit in the far right radicalisation of a generation.
917.) I’m brand new to this sub, but I’ve been saying this on other platforms for awhile. I was never a big JRE person, but I’d check in once in a while depending on the guest. 

He gives a platform for way too shady people and he’s not informed enough to conduct a proper interview and ask relevant questions. 

I don’t know what his actual political beliefs are, but I do know he panders to his audience, which is undoubtedly made up of a lot of MAGA people. 

Frankly, I think it’s irresponsible for someone with such a big platform to be so misinformed (or not informed at all) on a variety of issues.
918.) r/enemystands
919.) Why do white people want to kill transgenders? Like seriously? What the fuck have they done that warrants death? They just want to be treated equally.
920.) Wanna take a guess as to what will happen to him?

(Hint: the answer is nothing, and also probably other right-wing cretins jumping to his aid, calling him a great guy, etc)

It *should* be legal to hang people like him as traiors.
921.) But but but ThE vIoLeNt LeFt!!! 1!11!!!1
922.) His people = white people
923.) These people are evil.
924.) That literally made me ill.
925.) I love Trevor Noah.
926.) How anyone could possibly continue to "bothsides" the political situation in this country is beyond me.
927.) That man has serious mental issues, imo.
928.) Never even heard of this person. Does he work for Breitbart?
929.) The Christian Taliban is probably the biggest threat to our country today. When Reagan was elected in 1980, the Moral Majority started making inroads into politics. Today, these fundamentalist Christians are on their way to turning this country into a theocracy. For anyone who values free-thinking and believes, like The Constitution says, that this country should not establish any official religion, this group and their influence should be very worrisome.
930.) May the Lord open.
931.) /r/FuckBothHuckabees /s
932.) I've heard from countless angels that said he's going straight to hell.
933.) The dear thing is really bothering me even though I know that there are bigger issues here.
934.) This has been tried before with the pride flag but this strategy of symbol appropriation that fascists and their kin like to use only works when the symbol they chose lacks an established political narrative. 

The okay hand and pepe both were generic enough but widespread enough that they could successfully force a narrative with those symbols. Most people don't see the gay pride flag and associate it primarily with diversity between races but with gay pride.
935.) Dumb stunt. Dumb kids.
936.) The internet is a really... it's a place all right.
937.) I’ve seen some of these before back when Australia had the gay marriage “vote”...

So not only are these lame propaganda, they’re also really old and stale
938.) Is is incredible how corrupt border patrol is.
939.) Used to be, the crazies would claim to talk to God.  Now, its Trump.
940.) I want to say it's not likely, but it's also plausible.
941.) I can't wait for Trump to knight him. /s
942.) I wonder how many of the local police that assisted the FBI with the arrest are actually members of the United Constitutional Douchebags, or whatever the militia’s name is?
943.) Truly saddened to share even a third of a name with this deeply racist pawn star understudy
944.) We get it, guys. You didn't have parents who cared a lot for you. They didn't give you enough hugs. They didn't tell you you're special.

So you found a "community" you could be part of. To feel good and special. To feel part of something, you feel like you've got something to live for, something to get up every morning for. You still crave that attention mommy and daddy didn't give you. It makes you happy that you go outside dressed like a muppet and have people stare at you.

You can now go to sleep happily tonight, still with butterflies in your belly because people gave you attention. Well done.
945.) I'm not saying that *all* conservatives are Nazis, but it sure seems like all nazis in America vote Republican and go to Trump rallies.
946.) Utter scum.
947.) aaaaaand same as the last public nazi pic, the dude has a phone in his shirt pocket
948.) Have alt-righters been saying WW2 Vets are white nationalists?
949.) Let's be honest... Not a single historian is a nationalist, because they know better.
950.) But the US army was segregated...
951.) The FBI arrested them
952.) Tbh, it's The Daily Heil, what can we expect.  Some of the most toxic comments sections you'll ever see.  It attracts the lowest of the low.  

Paul Dacre, and Murdoch were systematic in making DM readers vote against their best interests over Brexit, pushing the blame for the Economic crash onto minorities and the unemployed. it's the Fox News of the UK, it's not even a newspaper it's a satire of itself, and let's never forget that it supported Hitler during the war.
953.) This seems like a good time to send a PSA to the edgelords that seem to come here despite being told they're unwelcome.

Daily Mail. 'Nuff said.
957.) Brilliant. Awareness of the altright is a good thing.
958.) Good!  There's likely to be a bunch more that have infiltrated various police forces nationwide, and they need to be found and removed!  Otherwise they'll continue to follow their racist/sexist views and use their positions as police officers to harm minorities in the future.
959.) When alleged means proved it’s a dangerous time to live.

His comments about muslims

961.) Wooooow, and that is what 24/7 Fox News, AON and Talk Radio does to you Kids.
962.) I love your delivery.  You keep a cool head, let him talk, and present follow up questions very respectfully.
963.) "No he's fucked cause you hurt his feelings so now he has to cry on twitter everyday and go golfing instead of being president" - every trump supporter right now.
964.) Such a disgrace.  I don't even tell my grandchildren there is a president.  I'll wait until this buffoon and his bigoted followers are are in the rear view mirror.
965.) Okay. I hate the guy. Disgusted by him, wish they had something to impeach him with, but can we quit the the "Gotcha" journalism bullshit? There is so much more to focus on in the report that is damning than the one quote taken out of context. He said hes fucked because he was told if he got one of these special councils itd ruin his presidency. It pisses me off that there are 400 pages of content and everyone is focused on these two stupid words because they attract more attention than the other 400+ pages. This is all ive seen from the left since the report was released, and everyone on the right is just laughing at this poor attempt at pinning Trump.
966.) Even he underestimated how extremely devoted to him the suicide cult was
967.) /r/pledgetoimpeach - contact your reps and tell them to sign the pledge now!
968.) Beg to differ: I've said it before with regards to meeting deadlines, and I'm totally innocent in the eyes of the law. I've also known people to say those words upon receiving an undeserved traffic ticket. However, in the context of this investigation and what led him to utter those words, yeah I'd say he's guilty as hell.
969.) Lots of innocent people say that...    I’m not defending chief Cheetoo Mussolini by any means but..    just off the top of my head I bet a bunch of innocent people in the twin towers on 9/11 or on the Titanic that fateful April nite uttered these very words...      Hell I dropped a case of beer at work last week and said “I’m fucked”..  

Let’s all just hope he is ACTUALLY fucked, because that would be amazing..    somehow I see him sleezing his way out of this in some slimeball method and then he will blame “the dems” and his base of moron unclefuckers will cheer for joy...
970.) Meanwhile, his fucking Game of Thrones meme sits firmly at over 350,000 likes on Twitter, and regardless of how much of this feedback is artificial, one thing that can't be denied is that his supporters haven't budged even an inch.
971.) [removed]
972.) Perhaps we should address people on an individual basis rather than succumbing to tribalism with labels such as "alt-right" and "neo-nazi." Neither of these terms is particularly informative.
973.) Expect you are calling a large group of people neo nazis when a load of those people aren't, you calling them nazis shows a lack of understanding of the other side and a naivety in you. Also attempting to pressure other's into calling another large group of individuals under one negative name is a pretty fascistic move.

Should say I'm a very liberal dude myself and hate much of what I see on the right but it's important to see both sides for what they are and not demonise other individuals.
974.) If they act like a Nazi I'll call them such, however, if they don't I won't.

To me a Nazi is a person (or persons) who believes in the superiority of one specific race of humans over all others.

That to me is the fundamental part of being a Nazi, I'm a UK military vet and I  have many right wing friends but almost none of them believe in racial superiority (at least not openly). Many are racist (openly or subconsciously) but that doesn't automatically mean Nazi. They fear or even hate particular races, but again, that doesn't necessarily mean they believe they are superior. More often however, they hate particular groups that cross racial boundaries, such as liberals, muslims, immigrants etc etc.

Oh and btw, by US standards I'm pretty left wing, by my own UK standards I'm 'centre left'. I believe in cradle to grave welfare, single payer healthcare (nationalised) and I'm pro-immigration.
975.) I’ve said before, just what the hell is neo about these Nazis?
976.) For those of you who argue that alt-right  isn't the same as neo-nazi.

Richard Bertrand Spencer (born May 11, 1978) is an American neo-Nazi and white supremacist. Spencer created the term "alt-right", which he considers a movement based on "white identity".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer

I implore you, do not fall into their trap. Do not give them what they want. They are neo-nazis and their goal is to use terms like alt-right to muddy the waters, get the support of right-wingers who would otherwise reject avowed neo-nazis, and to be defended by liberals like yourselves.
977.) What is your definition of the alt right and a neo nazi?

If you are referring neo nazis as the ~30 meth-mouthed rednecks from the trailer park that protest with nazi flags on capital steps, who comprise a teeny tiny fraction of a percentage of our population, while the vast majority of of citizens, comprising of multitudes of white, black, brown, left, right, republican, democrat, etc. scorn and mock said neo nazis, then I would say you are accurate.

If you refer to the alt right as Milo Yiannopolous and his following of online trolls who parrot provocative talking points, and a few young, male meatheads who think they need "to fight the antifas" and do the same petty shit the far left idiots do at protests, then I would say you are also accurate.

The range of ideologies above, alt right to neo nazis, ranges from immaturity to ignorant hatred founded on literally being a brain dead degenerate. Neither of those groups represent any type of majority in the US, and both have so little financial and political power that blaming all of our problems on them and labelling all of your opponents as part of their ranks is just as ignorant as waving the nazi flags those trailer trash carry.

Frankly, its become exhausting.
978.) Did you vote for Hillary Clinton to stop them?
979.) Exactly, it’s the same kind of people just a different thing they’ve chosen to call themselves.
980.) They prefer "Republicans" - but you are correct - they are Nazis.
981.) I actually call them Alt-Right Nazis. I kinda see neo-nazis as the gangs of thugs like "Aryan Nation", I see the Nazis as Hitler Germany. Alt-Right Nazi are softer and more bitchy whose feelings are easily crushed but probably more dangerous because they hide and operate under the cloak of angry among fearful conservatives who are terrified of brown people.
982.) You know, this is how we get polarized. Instead of treating these people as individuals and actually talking and debating with them, you just slap on a strawman-esque label so that you don’t even have to address them.
983.) i think the main problem is differentiating people on the right vs actual neo nazis/alt right
984.) Alt-right is just same-old-right as far as I'm concerned.
985.) Agreed.  Seriously sick of all the legitimizing rhetoric that the media crams down our throats.  "Alt Right" instead of Nazi, "white nationalist" rather than white supremacist, calling Donald Trump "the US" in international coverage like we're a fucking monarchy.

People who put their names to that kind of crap are not journalists - I don't care who they are or what their history is.  They can't even be bothered to maintain basic contact with reality when *mildly criticizing* lawless fascist pigs, and just passively accept the rhetorical framing of totalitarian maniacs.
986.) Stop calling anyone on the right a nazi. It's inaccurate literally more than 99% of the time. Just because someone holds views you disagree with, or even because someone holds views you see as racist, DOES NOT MAKE THEM A NAZI, and insisting otherwise is a disgrace to what actually happened during WWII as well as being regressive to the very goals you are trying to achieve. Think for yourself.

988.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right

>In 2010, the American white nationalist Richard B. Spencer launched The Alternative Right webzine to disseminate his ideas. Spencer's "alternative right" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as paleoconservatism, the Dark Enlightenment, and the Nouvelle Droite. His term was shortened to "alt-right" and popularised by far-right participants of /pol/, the politics board of web forum 4chan.

>In 2015 it attracted broader public attention, particularly through Steve Bannon's Breitbart News—which Bannon described as "the platform for the alt-right"[5]—due to alt-rightist support for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

You won't get people to listen very long if you call every person who voted for Trump a neo-nazi, so, alt-right became the most palatable term. The truth of course is that a huge portion of his base are at best white nationalists and more likely straight up white supremacists
989.) “ Don’t tell the President “ again that about says it all, I truly believe he welcomes the interference.
990.) A big part of it is that Russia is bankrolling far-right extremist groups across the world.
991.) People are struggling to find their identity in today's world coupled with extreme tribalism. White nationalism is right there to fill that void.
992.) Natural human behavior
993.) It's rising because of exploding inequality and because mainstream liberals have offered nothing in terms of curbing the inequality, while the right offers hate and discrimination as a purported solution.

Basically mainstream liberals and the invisible backers of right wing extremism both have as their common goal to protect their gains against redistribution.

As long as liberals don't present a real solution to inequality right wing extremism will continue to grow and eventually make an end to liberal democracy.

Unfortunately, I think it's as with climate change, liberals will keep believing they can have their cake and eat it until they either join the bigots or are locked up in camps.
994.) We all know what this ACTUALLY is though...this is just the rise of Nazism, minus a WorldWar.

This has nothing to do with immigration. If it wasn't Immigration, it would be interracial relationships. There's always something bothering these "people". They're unable to live happily. It's like a genetic predisposition to anxiety.

First they expell the Muslims. Then it's anyone who isn't white. It's always the same garbage. We agree for free speech and nationalism but to these cretins, Western Culture = Whiteness. Plain and simple. People keep throwing around stats as if it explains people throwing up new modernized Nazi symbols and Roman salutes. This fear of white genocide is an irrational fallacy based on absolutely nothing. It's just bored white crazies who literally have nothing better to do. If they get their "EthnostateLOL" they'll just resume their imperialistic invasions of other places. They'll just go and Chase after the very people they kicked out, long after they've left. What is it about this portion of white people that allows for so much mental decay ? This is cancer incarnate. The crazy shit is that his is world wide. People who have nothing to do trying to find meaning by greifing others.

Granted, mass immigration is a terrible idea. Even for humanitarian purposes, placing millions on top of millions is never a good, given human nature.
995.) It's mainly because of whites in many historically white/European countries are decreasing at a rapid rate due to low birth rate and high immigration. This is evident as between 2010 and 2016 the non-muslim population of Europe actually decreased by 1.67m whilst the Muslim population increased by 2.92m. Also, studies show that if liberal immigration policies continue, countries such as Sweden will be 1/3 Muslim by 2050. These people have the right, in my opinion, to vote for parties that promise to stop this phenomenon or at least decrease it and if these trends continue don't be shocked that more and more people will become more right-wing.

996.) If the House sits around thinking about what they want to do with Trump instead of making changes for our country and forcing the Senate vote on these changes will show the American people that the Republicans just don’t care about anything but Trump. The Senate must start making moves and request to show they are serious.
997.) I'll take a stab at it.  He's a liar.
998.) “My father served in WW2, I can say whatever I want.” - Sean Hannity.

What a fucking douchebag
999.) you to forget he's a professional bullshit artist.
1000.) I thought I was the only one that remembered this!!! Still waiting!
1001.) Hannity is the mainstream version of Alex Jones.
1002.) Yeah, I remember that! How time flies, eh?
1003.) For us to forget.
1004.) Pussy
1005.) he probably paid an intern to try it and found out it really is torture
1006.) To grow a set of balls
1007.) He's probably waiting for Benjamin Ghazi to testify against President HRC. He'll celebrate by getting waterboarded after her impeachment trial 

&#x200B;

/s /s /s
1008.) Not Soon enough !
1009.) Does anybody else’s remember when Christopher Hitchen’s was actually waterboarded back in the Bush presidency for the exact opposite reason?
1010.) She is too soft, unfortunately. Trump is not a legitimate president and if we do not do something right now., they (Trump /Republicans/Russia) will attack us again. Fight back!
1011.) The way Omar has been smeared is disgusting. I will openky say I hate anyone who would acxuse others have having a loyalyty to a foriegn nation just bevause of somethijg like religion.
1012.) This guy again? Fuck Matt Shea.
1013.) The predictable outcome of spending 20+ years of courting the lunatic fringe
1014.) Any chance of arrest of these people?
1015.) He’s right - Nixon was a crook but he didn’t sell us out to the Russians
1016.) The difference is that in Nixon era Republicans cared about the US, the Constitution and at least some legal ramifications. 

In 2019 the Republicans are traitors to the US and the Constitution and are actively helping Trump violate everything that a President of the United States should stand for.
1017.) This whole thing confuses me. 

The Mueller report is either nothing, or it's Watergate, depending on which side you're listening to.
1018.) We need to find a More Liberal Left Winger to orate these charges!
(CA. Left Wing Democrat is not enough)
1019.) I'm sure Barr sent the full report directly to Trump. They have no issues lying about pretty much any subject.
1020.) Republicans don’t want to see it just ignore it and it will go away, look congress just lay the evidence out ( Mueller all but gave it to you ) impeach him for obstruction but don’t remove him from office, even if you foreword to AG he will drag his feet, but the Narcissistic Trump will  now know he was beaten, the fence sitters will know what kind of man and President he really is.
1021.) The dude's a felon in possession of weapons and ammunition and was charged as such. This guy wasn't interested in enforcing the law. If he was he wouldn't have had weapons and wouldn't have been a vigilante. This guy, and by extension, his group were just plain racists with guns, pure and simple.
1022.) theyre just going to join ICE formally and keep this shit up. Its what the KKK did. they put members in the police and govt to maintain their vigilante activity.
1023.) [removed]
1024.) This is an incredibly bad precedent they're trying to set.
1025.) What ever happened to the "Better Dead than Red" of yesteryear?  Have the Republicans become "Commies"?
1026.) Everything is wrong with Giuliani's moral system.
1027.) It's hard to reconcile that this is the same person who took down Gotti and the mob and lead NY in through it's darkest time. What a sad caricature of the person he once was. It boggles my mind that so many people who once had sterling reputations would willingly destroy their integrity beyond any possible rehab for Donald Trump of all people. The sheer human wreckage of his admin is just simply astounding
1028.) “*These are radical islamic terrorists and she [Hillary] won't even mention the word, and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism,*’” trump said during the Oct. 9 debate

Hey trump; Can you say **Radical Right-Wing Terrorists**?
1029.) These guys are terrorists.
1030.) I thought the Old Man from Pawn Stars passed away?
1031.) He’s the spitting image of Trump!
1032.) Should arrest his entire posse.
1033.) Jesus christ, as someone who's descended from Cuban Immigrants good fucking riddance. We need less white supremacist xenophobes feeling they should do a better job at "policing" minorities who just want to become Americans & get a better life by murdering them. there's a bit of corruption in border patrol as is[especially under trump] but these guys don't make shit any better.

hope the rest of his thugs are arrested and fucking get their asses kicked in prison too.
1034.) Impeachment is a political process designed to remove an elected official who refuses to uphold their oath of office. 

Even if every single line of the Mueller report were false impeachment should have been on the table 12 months ago.
1035.) Except for those pesky traitors to the US and the Constitution who I like to refer to as Republicans. 

Staying in power is their only goal.
1036.) What worries me is that now Nancy is talking like “ohhh, let’s focus on 2020. Impeachment is soooo distracting.”

Democratic pussies. We can do this AND win the election AND bury this asshole in the mountain of shame he deserves. He deserves the legacy of “The Idiotic, Cowardly President” that he so fears.
1037.) History and the Constitution

DEMANDS impeachment.
1038.) How did I know that despite what the Muller report stated, this page would still yell “IMPEACH?”
1039.) The issue is, even if we impeach him, he still has left a scar on america, and he made sure that his replacement is more shitty than he is. Impeachment will do nothing unless we fundamentally change the system that brought him to power in the first place.
1040.) Hahaha you must be delusional.
1041.) While certainly he’s unfit for office and should be removed. However, if the republicans don’t get on board it will be a waste. The senate must vote to convict. They won’t at this point. Focusing on legislation investigation and being a meaningful check on the executive branch will achieve more.
1042.) He was impeached before he was elected
1043.) “I’m not weak and scared. You’re weak and scared.”
1044.) I think the issue is his inferiority complex. Since he got where he is because of his father's money he's been forever trying to prove he's a superior businessman (which he isn't). 

Being president has been way over his head (like baby Bush) but since he's so paranoid he didn't let the people he appointed run the government (like baby Bush did). So the US is essentially the Titanic heading for an iceberg.
1045.) There is nothing more obvious than this moment (the release of the report) being the reason Barr was appointed AG. Cunts. All of them.
1046.) I hope that republicans are starting to see how mentally ill trump is. He's not only unqualified but he's almost psychotic.

Republicans need to wake up to the fact that they are enabling trumps mental illness by still supporting him.  They would do trump a favor by starting impeachment, which will make trump resign.   https://trofire.com/2019/04/14/signs-of-trumps-dementia-are-clear-as-day-psychologist-warns/

Republicans are COWARDS

 - If trump was a democrat, republicans would have already impeached him…
1047.) I believe all opposed to the corruption, crimes, and indecency of this administration should now on refer to him only as Cowardly President Trump. 

Just as he used Crooked to taint the reputation of Clinton, the use of Cowardly has the added benefit of being true.
1048.) If he really does have dementia/Alzheimer then we should try to address the issue but how does that make him weak and afraid? If one of my grandparents had health issues, I certainly wouldn't draw the conclusion your title have.
1049.) You guys sure are salty lol
1050.) That’s not what the article says - he says he wants the process to play itself out but it’s too early to begin impeachment immediately - which it is.
1051.) Tim Ryan is just another weak-kneed Liberal who knows he cannot beat Trump's 'Gaslighting' style of messaging. Tim Ryan cannot compete against Trump's control of the narrative, so he advocates giving up.
1052.) Is this the human trafficking Trump was on about?
1053.) Maybe he should have them arrested for false imprisonment and violation of civil rights?
1054.) You mean stop kidnapping.
1055.) Think they'll try to make it a 2A "well-regulated militia" argument for why they should be allowed to continue kidnapping people?
1056.) History and the Constitution

DEMANDS impeachment.
1057.) Deflection...from 1975.  They are both treasonous actions by the same party. Meanwhile Democrats got a blowjob.
1058.) Except nothings gonna happen to trump bc republicans are immoral bastards that don't care about the law and justice so long as the unfairness works in their favor. Turn it around and boom, suddenly everything is a grevious affront to Christian values and the Greatness of This Great Nation
1059.) He won't be President forever, regardless of what he wants.  At some point he'll be indicted for the money laundering, obstruction and treason he's committed and there's no pardon that can save him.
1060.) Guys.... let it go...
1061.) Here we goooo
1062.) Damn right - let’s get this going enough of the charades
1063.) New York "High Society" has known for years, as has anyone who pays any attention to these things, that Trump is a poor excuse for a human being. It's why they didn't want to have anything to do with him.
1064.) Is it, technically speaking, still considered an "accusation" if what you’re doing is pointing out the obvious truth?
1065.) The report will be delivered to congress today according to the article. What devilry are we supposed to expect in the meantime?
1066.) Accuses.

But doesn’t get up to do anything substantial about it.

Whats an accusation to the 40% of the country who won’t even believe substantial evidecence?
1067.) Nadler is right.
Barr's press conference today was an absolute disgrace.
1068.) There is just no reason for the question. It adds nothing, it only makes your count inaccurate. It doesn't matter if people are citizens. The Constitution makes zero distinction about citizenship. 

Counting non-citizens doesn't allow non-citizens to vote. Non-citizens still need protection under the law. 

"Foreign born" is not an issue unless someone is running for President.
1069.) First off, I find it... odd youre acting like emating the 3/5 compromise was a good thing?
1070.) So, that whole "3/5 compromise" thing? It turns out that in the 21st century, a lot of citizens don't like the idea of counting African-Americans as only three-fifths of a person.
1071.) This [link](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/citizenship/fourteenth_amendment_citizenship.php) provides some background about why the question of citizenship is so acrimonious.  

The underlying political fear is that decisions based on the census information will only count the citizen population.  If that were true, ***and it would be to the extent the portion of the government that adheres to a 'citizens-only' stance is able to control***, then areas with significant populations of aliens, or non-citizens if you prefer, would get the short end of the stick on those decisions.  The long list of related decisions fall into (my op) two main categories; reapportionment and distribution/allocation of financial resources.  Most importantly, the reapportionment process could continue to be prejudiced toward conservative leaning areas.  

Let me digress for a moment.  The framers of the Constitution deliberately left the question of who could vote to the several States.  The consequences of that are rather large, see the previous link.  Reapportionment was mostly left to the states, but two important pieces were specified; that slaves counted as 3/5 of a person in the Census, and that representation in the House was calculated on the basis of the Census. Nothing about gender, or age, or pretty much any other demographic, including if you could vote, only the condition of servitude.   To me, it's obvious the framers wanted to have the best number of all people to accurately reapportion, even if a substantial component of that population *could not  / was not allowed* to *vote.*  

There are some comments that claim it (the citizenship question) makes the count inaccurate.  Such claims are partly false. First, the Census Bureau is required to attempt to count *everyone.* Only afterward are the results tabulated and binned, and it's these tabulations that get used to make decisions.  Thus, if you don't have a citizenship question, then the reasoning is you can't make decisions based on citizenship data.  The reality is you can always make decisions, with or without data.  Just look at our current Administration. 

The claims are also partly true. The problem comes in that having such questions means a different rate of response.  Some non-citizens may, just on the basis of that question, choose not to respond to the Census questionnaire.  (Why is a separate topic, but relevant.)  There is always a certain non-respondent percentage, and inclusion of a citizenship question will increase this percentage. That will mean the raw count data is inaccurate because that segment is undercounted, so statistical estimations have to be used.  Those estimations have built-in bias.  Again, decisions will occur.  

Ok. Enough. Sorry about the text blocks, but does that help?
1072.) The only reason not to is because it is laughable to think a non-citizen would admit to not being a citizen. In the meantime, it's just another red herring for the masses to get stirred up over.
1073.) ...Gonna need the mother of all TLDR;s here.
1074.) Too hard to spell Mueller correctly?
1075.) Title should say Full redacted Muller report
1076.) TLDR:

1. Trump and his campaign collaborated with Russia during Russia's meddling in the 2016 American Presidential election.
2. Trump lied about his dealings with Russia during the election.
3. Trump committed numerous instances of obstruction of justice to cover 1, and 2.
1077.) [removed]
1078.) Ha! Screw you Democrat’s! Trump2020
1079.) He might do a better job than Barr, who still released a report that clearly shows Trump broke the law.
1080.) Reposted with a better title and link. Which I hope will stop the flags for editorializing.
1081.) In my opinion, I believe everyone except for extreme out a wack radicals believe that there is climate change. The difference is from the the action that is taken on both sides. Democrats want to preserve the earth at the temp is it right now, so the world for animals and humans can enjoy it. Republicans however, realize the sad truth: climate change is inevitable. You are never going to stop cows from farting, and it’s going to take God to come down to Earth to fully stop carbon emissions, and even these new renewable energies have their problems. Solar energy actually still creates carbon, and wind power kills many flying animals. Wake up America. Climate change is inevitable. What we should be focusing on is how to preserve animal and human life so it will be able to adapt to climate change.
1082.) [removed]
1083.) So much secrecy for a party that claims to desire small government.
1084.) He’s making Putin proud.
1085.) Am I completely off-base or does that seem like it should be impeachment material?

I mean, that's pretty serious.
1086.) Lawless af
1087.) The Russpublican regime been in *open* insurrection against the Constitution since day one, and yet the media keeps calling it an "administration."

One wonders if they call the North Korean regime the "Kim Jong Un administration."
1088.) This is what pisses me off the most: they're outright disregard for the rule of law, and Dems aren't fighting hard enough to hold them accountable. I understand they can only do so much, but they need to be going to the Nth degree to subpoena documents while getting it out to all the media (with the voracity conservatives always do) that Republicans and Trump are trying to circumnavigate the law to protect themselves.

I keep holding hope that they'll be held accountable one day, but each day, that hope wanes a bit.
1089.) Wanna be dictator ass
1090.) Public president wants to continue being a private citizen.
1091.) It’s a dictatorship
1092.) **V O T E**  Anyone but trump    

Seriously, I often wonder if republicans would be happier living under a cutthroat KGB butcher dictator like Russia’s Putin…
1093.) Totally cool, totally legal...
1094.) Seriously. WHAT. THE. FUCK. How has the democratic party become so mismanaged to be led by such blind cowards?
1095.) This kind of cowardice is why people rightly view the Democratic Party as weak. Guess what? In this county people despise cowards. Congress has a moral and constitutional duty and poll numbers be damned! History is watching and Hoyer just secured his place right next to Neville Chamberlain
1096.) Aaaaaand trump forgave corporate bank fines that are due to the US...

Quid pro quo for not following the subpoenas I wonder
1097.) Ah, *finally* the deep-sea, fishing expeditions can begin.
1098.) Therein lies the real problem.  If you do that, then you give up the opportunity to vote for a candidate in the democratic primary.
1099.) Another consideration is whether or not you care if Dems win in 2020. Bill Weld, John Kasich, or most any non-Trump GOP candidate has a better chance of beating a generic Democrat than Trump. The best chance of a DNC sweep in 2020 is running AGAINST Trump, but that leaves open the chance that he'll be re-elected.
1100.) I don't think that would really hurt Trump. I think if that's your goal, vote in the democratic primary for who you think has the best shot at beating Trump. This may or may not be the same as who you would most want as president.
1101.) I think this is a great idea... give the republicans a taste of their own noxious medicine.

trump won simply because of voter suppression: http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/voter-suppression-wisconsin-election-2016/

**V O T E**  Anyone but trump    

Seriously, I often wonder if republicans would be happier living under a cutthroat KGB butcher dictator like Russia’s Putin…
1102.) Because even with a bunch of people doing that, Trump will be getting the nomination. He is still supported by ~89% of Republicans. Even if that pool has become smaller (it has), the amount of people needed to take him out is near impossible to get. I am happy that someone is choosing to primary Trump and getting him to waste campaign contributions but I see little chance of him having an effect. 

Better to focus on picking a candidate that can beat him. You would think it would be a cinch but then again, the 2016 election should also have been a cinch.
1103.) I switched from independent to vote against an incumbent democratic governor. He still won.
1104.) Trump is going to win the nomination no matter how unpopular, it's better to use your vote for the candidate you want
1105.) It's kind of like having more than one account on Reddit and then using them to inflate up/down votes. It is considered cheating by most people, a dirty trick to convince others that your opinion is liked or other opinions are not liked by other Redditors.

We all read Amazon reviews to better understand the quality of a product. And we all know fake reviews are among the things we read and we try to sort those out as invalid information. No one likes to be conned or duped or manipulated.

But dirty tricksters are also widely accepted by the very same people who hate it when the tricks are used against themselves.

So, it's a matter of what you think is appropriate behavior.
1106.) No one is talking about the fact that you have down ballot elections! In my state there is going to be several local offices to vote for, not primary not run off, but actual elections that count that day. You can’t vote Bill Weld (R) and down ballot (D). Your ballot will be tossed out.
1107.) Oy. The heartbreaking reality is that you're not wrong. 

&#x200B;

Unless, that is, [you live in Maine](https://www.sightline.org/2018/06/15/the-voting-system-democrats-and-republicans-are-afraid-of/) and Maine extends its upgraded voting system to the primaries. 

&#x200B;

If other states adopted ranked-choice voting, having a field of several qualified and interesting candidates would actually be a good thing! Imagine!
1108.) So what is the best strategy for a liberal living in an absolutely solid red state? Any benefit voting in the Republican primary?
1109.) If I weren't a Democratic PC and thus legally required to be a registered Dem, I'd do just this. And not just because of Trump, with only one exception all the politicians who represent me at the state and federal level are whackadoo conservatives of one stripe or another.

&#x200B;

It'd be great if we could do this on a large organized scale.
1110.) I think Bill Weld is the only Republican I ever voted for. Of course, that was when he ran for governor of Massachusetts against John “when you’ve had a long life and you’re ripe, then it’s time to go” Silber.

If you don’t have any strong feelings about which Democrat should win the nomination, sure, take a Republican ballot and vote for Weld. The odds of him *winning* the Republican nomination are close to zero, but I wouldn’t mind seeing him get a good fraction of the primary vote.

Dictators and wannabe-dictators love to project images of strength. They don’t just want to be seen as the guys who got 51% of the vote, because they don’t anyone to contemplate a way to turn that 51% into 49%. That’s why just before the Iraq invasion, Saddam Hussein was “re-elected” with 100% of the vote. That’s why, back in they heyday of the Chicago Democratic machine, Mayor Daley would do absolutely everything in his power to run up the score for machine candidates, even when the opposition had no hope of winning. And that’s why Trump obsesses over silly things like the size of his inauguration crowd.
1111.) Because victory over rightness is how we got into the current state; not how we get out of it.
1112.) If he succeeds and is more popular than the democratic  candidate in the general...
1113.) Because he might be a stronger candidate than Trump?
1114.) I did this once to vote for McCain over W.  I was in republican mailing lists for years.  It’s not worth the pain.
1115.) This is why you should be able to vote in both primaries. They are technically two entirely different elections.
1116.) Because Bill Weld isn't going to win, and you should vote for whom you want the democratic nominee to be?
1117.) the sad fact of the matter is that when the economy is good, the incumbent almost always wins. all we can do is vote and get it over with. unfortunately, we will almost definitely see a trump 2020 victory because he hasn't done much legislatively that would turn republicans off or stir up non voters. morally, he is a disgrace, but nobody seems to care about that. this is all just an annoying TV show to most americans
1118.) The way for the Democrats to win is to come up with a better economic plan that will actually help the productive, overworked, and squeezed middle class. This has been a problem for the past decade as I have heard very little from the Democrats that would convince me that they are going to fight some meaningful battles for me. 

Trump has actually been an improvement in that regard, which is why his personal shenanigans and controversies are not going to matter in the election. Much like with Bill Clinton... he may have been an inveterate womanizer, but the country prospered under his leadership.
1119.) Because as a card-carrying liberal, Trump is the president you really want.
1120.) Trump has a pay to play scheme going on.
1121.) Which is fantastic if you own stock, etc. It's not great for the rest of us.
1122.) And that accelerated growth will kick in any minute now!...
1123.) This would be a good time to start a business.......
1124.) We all got our huge pay raises, since they didn't have to pay taxes, right? /s
1125.) Shocker! /s
1126.) I'm 20 years old. I made about 17,000$ in taxed income and also worked doing a lot of side jobs, all of which were filed under a 1099 because I try to be a decent human being. I made 3600$ in these businesses. I had to pay 222$ dollars altogether after filing state and federal.
1127.) Did someone say Andrew Yang?
1128.) This is great, as [half to three quarters](https://www.google.com/search?q=corporate+tax+incidence+falls+on+workers&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS765US765&oq=corporate+tax+incidence+falls+on+workers&aqs=chrome..69i57.4742j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of the burden of corporate income taxes falls on workers.

&#x200B;

Just because a company pays a tax doesn't mean they are the people ultimately impacted. The employer portion of FICA is the most obvious example here - it makes no difference who actually writes the check (firm or worker) since the cost to the firm and the benefit to the worker is the same either way.
1129.) This really isn't a bad thing though...


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1E4sQzEcR8
1130.) They are the ones who wrote the laws. What a stupid bitch.
1131.) More projection from the least intellectual and professional executive office in 150 years.
1132.) She was just being a common bitch.
1133.) Says that our current Congresspeople (and we all know which side of the aisle she's referring to) aren't smart enough to look at tax pages. Never mind that many of our senators were previously constitutional scholars, accountants, lawyers, etc., and in many cases, helped write the tax code in the first place.

&#x200B;

Literally lies for a living for a man baby who speaks and writes at a third grade level, believes that you have to present ID to purchase cereal, and that windmills cause cancer.

Okey-dokey.
1134.) I'm going to go out on a limb here, and surmise she's referring to the Democratic Party majority in the House.
1135.) are you implying she was saying women specifically are too dumb?
1136.) Wow. Just wow. We’re gonna get this upset over a simple set of words that you’re reading way too far into. Saying “congressmen and women” means that the “congress” is inflected upon the “women” as well because of the “and”. Why does this matter so much?
1137.) Here’s a taste of Donald Trump’s other illegal activities (from 2016):

* Donald Trump has a long history of not honoring contracts with construction companies
* Donald Trump has knowingly and intentionally defrauded Trump University students, fleecing them out of thousands of dollars
* He may have illegally coordinated with his SuperPac
* He illegally used corporate resources to pay an employee to write a political speech
* He violated federal law by claiming proceeds from various Trump products would go to charity, although there is no evidence that Trump ever donated the money to charity
* He violated IRS rules by using $12,000 from his charity organization to purchase a Tim Tebow helmet
* He violated election laws by emailing foreign officials to solicit political contributions
* He violated federal laws by offering Ben Carson a job in exchange for his endorsement
* His employees violated a U.S. trade embargo by pursuing commercial activities in Cuba when it was illegal to do so
* He’s run afoul of election laws by using campaign contributions to pay $6 million to his own businesses
* He violated Wisconsin election laws by talking with voters as they stood in line to vote
* He violated New York state education laws for operating a for-profit investment school without the required license
* His foreign policy proposals would violate NATO
* He’s violated copyright law for using copyrighted images without permission
* Many of the proposals he has vowed to pursue as President violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments of the Constitution
* Trump broke New York state law by lobbying to prevent an Indian casino from opening in the Catskills
* His vow to use torture on suspected terrorists would violate the Geneva conventions. He would be committing war crimes.
* He broke anti-discrimination laws to keep a mob boss gambling at one of his casinos
* He violated immigration laws by misrepresenting his company on work-visa applications
1138.) ... surprizing no one.
1139.) The guy that says things that will make him look good and never does them said something that made him look good then never did it? How out of character...
1140.) Donald Trump never keeps his promises unless they benefit him.

If only his supporters realized that.
1141.) He made it to the 7/11 fund. That’s not right???
1142.) I’m sure in Trump’s mind Omar was one of the thousands of Muslims celebrating on rooftops.
1143.) Too bad his cult will never care. They think:
- he means well
- all politicians are bad 
- just give him a chance

40% of this country is mentally challenged and cannot comprehend reality.
1144.) Donald Trump not following through on a promised charitable donation? Surely you jest.
1145.) Also took federal monies to the tune ok $150k supposed to be for small business.
1146.) I thought that was obvious when they labeled their military as a terrorist organization.
1147.) I mean it’s been pretty obvious they have been considering this since Bolton took office.
1148.) And it would merely be the *second* unelected GOP tyrant starting a war that bankrupts the country and destabilizes the world this century.

Why do we tolerate the existence of this criminal organization / hate group / brazen terrorist conspiracy masquerading as a political party?  These people are all psychopaths and cowardly heel-clicking goosesteppers who find it comforting to follow psychopaths.  Every single one of them.
1149.) Hooray 😑 /s
1150.) I wonder if there’s an election looming in the future?  /s
1151.) I am skeptical. They can't lay the legal groundwork for anything.

Don't trust that John Bolton guy though! He's a neo-con scammer, Trump should never have hired him.
1152.) Well it would get the Mueller report off the front page so i wouldn’t put it past him
1153.) Eh. What's one more war at this point? Let's Roman Republic this bitch! Destiny ain't Manifested until we can beat that 118 year semi-continuous warfare record from 146 BCE!

Edit: Come on guys. Obvious /s....
1154.) Not if he was still black.
1155.) He is not necessarily wrong. The affordable care act was initially a Republican policy proposal from back in the day.

The two sides have, at least, in rhetoric have been pushed further apart.
1156.) Economic policies, maybe. Social policies, no.
1157.) he's seen as a moderate re3publican now, so..
1158.) I've been saying the same about Bill Clinton since he took office.
1159.) I mean I support this but it is pretty hypocritical
1160.) In what certain situations would abortion be ok, in your opinion?
1161.) It is a grave and craven mistake to limit a time proven surgical procedure for any reason.  Abortion saves women’s lives.
1162.) You see like a reasonable person, not a troll, so for me it depends on when you believe life starts. Morning after pill...absolutely yes. Thats preconception. Have you put any thought into what your certian situations would be?
1163.) Your view of only certain circumstances is going to prove a problem. Gov't needs to stay out people's circumstances in most cases. Let God sort out we sinners concerning the issue.
1164.) Here's my hang up, no one likes abortion, no one wants to see it happen, no one wants to go through it. However, the reality is, there are problems abortion fixes like rape and mothers safety. If a conservative, or anyone for that matter, came forward with better solutions to these problems I would whole heartedly support them. But I can't support someone who just says no to a solution without offering one themselves. I hate abortion, I wish it never had to happen, but I don't see a better alternative.
1165.) I apologize if this has already been brought up; but ... you *do* realize that research shows that as many as *half* of all fertilized human eggs abort *themselves* naturally? If Texas passes their death-penalty-for-abortion law, will they be killing their entire female population? And before you scoff at this, *how exactly do they propose to know* if a woman miscarried naturally, or maybe drank some pennyroyal tea or something? Once you're accused, it's harder to prove a negative. This terrifies me.
1166.) I think you might need to provide a little something more to go off of in order to foster a discussion.  Like, I guess- what is it that you want from us?  Do you have a question to be answered?  Want to be told why we may or may not disagree with your stance?  Want to understand the pro-choice side?
1167.) I am a liberal that would like to see the number of abortions reduced without making abortion illegal. Making abortion illegal will not stop abortions. It will make safe abortions costly and cheap abortion unsafe.

The way we reduce abortions is by reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies. We need to identify the causes of unwanted pregnancies and focus on changing these problems. 

It seems to me that most unwanted pregnancies can be reduced with education and raising the economic levels of all.

Since 2016 life in the US has been like a bad dream that we just can’t wake up from and for the first time I’m seriously worried that they’ll get away with it. God only knows what kind of a hellscape the US becomes if that happens but I am genuinely worried that it will

1179.) Welcome. I can’t say there aren’t any nutty liberals, but I hope most of the community reacts positively and welcomes you. Most human beings are trying to do the best they can with the information they’re given. Bad information happens in any sphere, but it is my honest belief that most people are not malicious but protective of those closest to them. Understanding can go a long way in harmonizing basic philosophy on life.
1180.) 1. What did you experience that was the tipping point for you?

2. What were the nagging questions or issues in the back of the mind that finally started to assert themselves?
1181.) Welcome to the land of logic, compassion and inclusion
1182.) Conservative here , why the switch ?
1183.) I don’t think liberals have fat blue pills. We don’t use drugs to try to control you political beliefs. I don’t understand why conservatives think “getting red pilled” or whatever is a great metaphor. Isn’t the “getting woke” metaphor a better explanation of the Matrix anyway?
1184.) Based on the shift of your opinion and perspective what are some factors that could  help bring others to their own realization. I have many friends that are well into the conservative mindset, while I do talk politics with them, I avoid trying to convince them to change their views. For example, are there things Trump has done or said that became ideas you were not able to uphold?
1185.) Still have those red tendencies as I see that you asked for questions but are providing no answers
1186.) Somebody had to pay more taxes because they no longer get the full SALT deduction.  The only way to get a conservative to understand is when it happens to them directly.
1187.) What makes you believe that you were conservative to begin with? Or what kind of views did you hold and what kind of analysis did you perform to reach those views?
1188.) I love how liberals and conservatives think they aren't the same thing! 🤣😂🤣

1193.) But my penis is very small and I need an outlet for my frustration!
1194.) You know not every person that shares right leaning views is a thoughtless drone waiting to deploy meaningless insults as a way to bully people to make themselves feel better. 

For example I lean completely left when it comes to social issues save abortion, which I flip flop on. But I tend to lean right on fiscal issues. 

In a perfect world the balance between helping the less fortunate and keeping a budget would be equal, but we all know that that is not how the government works. People’s greed gets in the way on all sides and kickbacks happen or someone decides to sign a bill they disagree with if it will get their own through. That’s why I usually lean towards the side that has the most cost effective fiscal goals, whether it’s the right or left. In my own opinion it tends to be the right leaning side that does so more often.
1195.) Hello.

You are receiving this message because you posted in defense of Donald Trump. I no longer provide individual responses on this matter. It has been my experience that Trump supporters are universally incapable of accepting verifiable truths about him and, by extension, themselves, thus rendering discussion pointless and, therefore, a waste of time.

I wish you all the best in your ongoing battle with reality.

Yours respectfully, a logical person.
1196.) This post describes itself
1197.) >You may be surprised to hear that you did not, in fact, originate this behavior, nor did you oringate it.           

Right?!

Plus these neo Nazi trolls repudiate using vetted, cross-checked sources that follow ethical standards in journalism, thus making any appeal to facts when engaging with them null and void. They not only do not care about all the people they are hurting both directly and indirectly through the spread of blatant lies, they fact they relish it.

1200.) Tbf the purpose of the university was to educate you. It is not the responsibility of every random redditor to bear the burden of enlightening the stubborn ignorance of all they encounter.
Lots of people do take the time and effort but I don't see how they are obligated to.
1201.) Probably because for the most part, you need to actually be arguing in good faith. When you're face to face with someone, you can read all the signs if a person is being serious, or just looking to argue without so much as considering the opposition.

On reddit...about all you can do is keep an eye on their rhetoric style, and check their comment history for red flags (Anyone with an R/TheDonald in their comment history is not gonna budge)

It's all complicated by the fact that there are people whose literally job, paid to do, is to stir shit so people don't want to take the energy to have a proper debate. 

Now, that isn't to say we're innocent, because we're human and as fallible as anyone else. That means that when you come from, or are arguing for the sake of a minority that has had decades to centuries worth of being silence, there's a tendency to want to wall out people whose ideas are basically a threat to every scrap of freedom you and those who came before you fought for, often at the cost of their freedom, safety, and even lives. Nobody wants to allow someone else, a total stranger even, to barge in and undo that.

It comes down to a risk vs reward ratio. Is dealing with this person whose view points means the undoing of everything I as a liberal hold dear, worth listening to? Will I gain anything from it? Will THEY gain anything from it? Can I afford to let that person take up real estate inside my head? 

It gets complicated, and it leads to vulnerability. These days it just feels easier to not take the risk. These day's it kind of feels like the talking points are over. In the era of unlimited access to information, how much harder can you argue for your cause? The lines in the sand are drawn. People either want one thing, or the other. There isn't really room to compromise on them.
1202.) I have many conversations in here with people in good faith. 

But when people argue in bad faith, the conversation is over. They do not want to change in fact they want to lie to decieve others. And continuing to argue with them only validates thier intentional lies. 

If you can't tell the bad faith from the good, then you have a really big problem.
1203.) With me, what makes the difference is whether someone expresses their racist or sexist views in a trollish insulting way, or rather they just say what they feel with no apparent mean or taunting intentions. 

I have very patiently got into long discussions with people who had views they just never really sat down and looked at maybe; or just people who seemed willing to hear what I said and respond without getting nasty.


But the thing is, sexism went virtually unchallenged for thousands of years in Western culture. Hell, in Eastern culture too, but that's another conversation. Women just plain don't want to hear it anymore.


You know the instant negative remarks, the insults, the judgment, the belittling, that you see people expressing in liberal spaces, the ones that bother you ... that kind of thing is EXACTLY what women have been putting up with for centuries ourselves, and we're tired of it. Our reaction to the negativity is just like yours, only it took quite a bit longer.
1204.) Going to be pardoned by his buddy Trump.

1210.) I think it’s a complicated issue and it isn’t the best idea to quote someone without full context; however, I feel Lieu was in the right here as I don’t believe Owens’ answer was misrepresented, and it directly related to the matter of discussion. I found it interesting that in her defense (or rather attack against Lieu’s methods) she claims that “white nationalism is being exaggerated as a threat to the country, when really white nationalists are the scapegoats” (paraphrasing). Smdh

“*These are radical islamic terrorists and she [Hillary] won't even mention the word, and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism,*’” trump said during the Oct. 9 debate

Hey trump; Can you say **Radical Right-Wing Terrorists**?
1212.) Diamond and Silk never praised Hitler.
1213.) I think her comments were really about the common associations (ie Hitler) with the concept of Nationalism vs the actual meaning of the word.  It is clear that she is not defending Hitler but people believe what they want to believe.  I have heard a lot of back and forth between eggheads discussing the meaning of the word and it seems to have some plasticity.

They need an arsenal at hand just to feel like normal men just feel by default.
1219.) But they don’t hate women guys, srsly!
1220.) How can he just trample on the Constitution like this and not get in trouble?  Seriously.
1221.) I hope that republicans are starting to see how mentally ill trump is. He's not only unqualified but he's almost psychotic.

Republicans need to wake up to the fact that they are enabling trumps mental illness by still supporting him.  They would do trump a favor by starting impeachment, which will make trump resign.  

Republicans are COWARDS

 - If trump was a democrat, republicans would have already impeached him…
1222.) No one is going to be able to do a good job running the DHS, because luckily for us all, Trump is a coward that doesn't know what he wants.

He wants to install draconian rules at the border, so he tells his DHS Secretary to do some cruel shit. 

His hardcore base goes crazy with glee, and everyone else gets pissed off. People get so angry that Trump reverses his position and throws someone under the bus.

This shuts up most of his critics but his base goes insane because he's not being cruel to brown people anymore.

How can you enforce the policies of a man that has no policies?
1223.) We need small red States to produce progressive leaders to run for Senate seats to get out of this bullshit
1224.) Get those fuckers out of there!!!
1225.) So much for the ‘Law & Order’ president as if anyone who listened with a critical mind wouldn’t have seen that Trump is not interested in law and order but authoritarianism to benefit his croanies. He isn’t even interested in his base as they will likely lose their health care pay more for less and lose any infrastructure they need (unless they are willing to pay tolls on private roads etc).
1226.) This will never happen . People will not be murdered because they have an abortion.
1227.) So we just set aside all the racism and lying and idiocy because a few more people have gotten dead end minimum wage jobs they can’t afford to lose because they live below the poverty line even through they’re  working ?

Honestly the reason I hate trump the most is because of people like you. He himself is a joke. You made him a real threat.
1228.) He didn't make unemployment go down. It's been going down before he was even in office.
1229.) How on earth do you attribute any of those figures to the president?
1230.) Why can't I hate him for his personality?
1231.) Because he is a stupid, amoral, narcissistic, elitist without an ounce of empathy, curiosity, or work ethic. For starters...
1232.) 2 honest questions: (1) how old are you and (2) why are you interested in American politics?
1233.) Children in cages.

&#x200B;

That alone is enough to hate him. But he's done so much more
1234.) A. Your economic numbers are all kinds of fucked up.

The unemployment rate was 4.8 in jan 2016. It is 3.8 now. How is that 4 percent improvement? 

The gdp was 2.0 in 2016 and 2.6 in 2018. How is that 2 percent improvement? (He promised 4-6 percent gdp, by the way.)

I have no idea what the 3 million number is? Just total jobs gained? Obama created 8.9 million over 8 years, so that's about on Obama levels. That may be accurate, but not some kind of amazing number. 

And I think your wage number is close, but 3 percent is supposed to be solid. 1.2 isn't even keeping up with inflation. (Obama had 2.2 percent in 2016 and trump complained about it, and it wasn't that great)

B. What do we hate? 

1. The overt dishonestly and intentional lies. "Windmills cause cancer" "you have to have I'd to buy cereal" "they're rooting in sanctuary cities" and on and on. 

Willful lies. Intentionally deceiving. 

These kill any attempts at any real conversation. 

2. Willful ignoring of science for profit. From global warming to just basic environmental policy, he's perfectly fine to poison us if s company can make a buck off of it. 

3. Zero respect for anything. He hates all professionals. Hates other national leaders of our allies. Treated them like pure shit and lies about them. 

And the says he trusts dictators. Lol

Foreign policy is what presidents are supposed to focus on and he is beyond a massive failure, but a true nightmare.
1235.) 1. He is deregulating everything in government. 
2. He encourages and influenced the rise if white nationalists 
3. He spends most of his time golfing and campaigning.
4. He speaks at a 4th grade level.
5 He thinks he knows more than the generals 
6. He listens to Fox News to make his decisions.
1236.) I disliked Trump long before he ran for president.  As someone in the construction industry, watching a serial bankruptee ruin firm after firm while lining his own pockets was infuriating.  Lots of builders and designers have worked on Trump projects, but few, if any, ever do a second.  He thinks this makes him a smart negotiator, but he's just an amoral bully that always had it good and never learned empathy or a sense of responsibility.

He benefited from Democrat policies for many years and supported them in turn.  He told everybody that, if he ran for president, it would be as a Republican because they are gullible.  He did exactly that and caters to a base that hangs on his every false word.

As president he says one thing, does another, and is continuing to be a bully.  He takes credit when he should praise others and blames others for pretty much everything.
1237.) i think income inequality may have gotten worse

also, all the stuff that’s not about jobs
1238.) Well, start with these:  [https://www.needtoimpeach.com/impeachable-offenses/](https://www.needtoimpeach.com/impeachable-offenses/)
1239.) He also lied about releasing his tax returns and about raw dogging a porn star and illegally paying her off. 

Nepotism: His kids are spoiled entitled lying monsters who should not be replacing actual experts. 

His wife has a "be best" internet bullying philosophy that apparently has no problem with her husbands twitter bullshit. 

He eats ketchup on well done steak
1240.) https://www.multpl.com/unemployment/table/by-year
1241.) Because hes sacking the government and the country for personal gain, he's a shitty person with no morals and has done very terrible things in office, lied to us or misled us over nine THOUSAND times, has absolutely horrific stances on human rights policy, has funneled more wealth into the top 1% than any other administration in US history, turned an excellent bull market into a bear market in about a year, destroyed US credibility on a global scale, gutted the state department and left over 50 embassador seats open (jobs critical to US foreign trade and diplomacy, and critical to preventing unnecessary wars), violated multiple laws like the emoluments laws and nepotism laws, has commit tax fraud, put corporate crooks in high power government positions who then began dismantling agencies like the EPA and, more recently DHS.


I could go on all fucking day.


Edit: He took a 500 million dollar business deal from the chinese government to look the other way when the chinese got caught stealing information from every US citizen with a ZTE phone. He allowed a US resident to be murdered by a brutal regime and then offered to sell the regime nuclear technology.
1242.) Over 70% of those jobs are in California.
1243.) Who’s surprised he doesn’t understand laws?  Anyone? Anyone?
1244.) Every time you think that Trump has gone as low as possible that he’s the most vile person alive he finds a way to go lower. There is no bottom
1245.) How has he not been impeached yet?
1246.) Impeachment is too good but we need it.
1247.) Who hasn’t he told to break the law at this point? Don’t we all just agree that rich white people don’t actually follow any of the laws that exist? At worst they pay fines that amount to a tiny percentage of their wealth.
1248.) Non-American here. 

I’ve asked this question on the same story in another sub, but want to ask it here as well, as I’d really like to know the answer. 

For at least the last year (or even most of his presidency), every time Trump does something, everyone says he can be impeached for this or impeached for that.  Mueller made some report that was supposed to be utterly damning to the president so he can be swiftly impeached. 

Yet there appears to be no progress or even talk of ever actually impeaching him for these seemingly endless impeachable acts. 

Where is all the impeaching at?
1249.) Wake me up when this turd gets flushed !
1250.) https://i.imgur.com/ghdLuFC.jpg
1251.) So much for the ‘Law & Order’ president /s
1252.) My thoughts, the President, Vice President and members of Congress must make public their tax returns yearly. 
1253.) Federal rule of law has been defunct since January of 2017.  This is a petty dictatorship.

But I'm so glad ~~Philippe Petain~~ Nancy Pelosi thinks even trying to enforce the Constitution against the Russian-backed insurgency would be pointless.  Ugh.
1254.) They say it would be a national security risk to release them. Besides the shady stuff the returns could possibly expose, it could set this new whacky bar on how much the rich get away with In regards to documenting both income and expenses. Kind of like testing the limits on how accounting wizards use their magic to turn gold into shiny plastic turds when needed.

Edit: grammar and spelling.
1255.) Dont hide it. Youre an adult. Its not their place to decide what party you're affiliated with. So what if they have a problem with it. You are your own person, and should be treated as such. My extremely right wing parents are pissed that I vote Democrat, but ive essentially told them to fuck off, because their kind are dying out, and I have the right to vote the way I believe.
1256.) You might, lots of campaign mail, and it sounds like you have reason to fear they’ll be more than unhappy. Protect yourself first. Do you have maybe a different address you could use in the time being like a friend’s?
1257.) You can sign up for a bunch of newsletters, etc. from both parties.  Throw in some Green and Libertarian stuff too.  Just tell them that your name/ address must be out there since now you can vote.

There are many Republicans in Hawaii that register as Democrats just so their vote can help determine the opponent in local races and primaries.
1258.) I suggest total and open honesty in all things and if that hurts your parents, that is because they have issues, not you. However, that is internet stranger advice and best taken lightly.
1259.) Odds are this will be the only real document that openly says it. They may send campaign literature, but they send it to anyone.

And frankly, if some of the campaign literature did say it. It's often wrong and unfounded. Just blame the "stupid Democrats" for getting it wrong. 

Fox news them.

Always blame the Democrats and you can get away with anything.
1260.) I'm not that well informed, and tend to just sit and listen to my Jewish friends on this. From their perspective, Israel is already a debated situation within the Jewish American communities because of how strongly orthodox Israel is in terms of it's government leaders. It's a complex situation I'm still trying to learn about.

I really don't see any modern-minded Jewish person having that much loyalty to Israel that they'd depart from the Democratic party over these issues though. 
1261.) Whenever you see a political ad about Democrats being against Israel, remember that it was paid for by Many Fine People.
1262.) Fox News has carte blanche and shouldn't even have a license.  It's time to call out their yellow journalism.
1263.) **V O T E**  Anyone but trump    

Seriously, I often wonder if republicans would be happier living under a cutthroat KGB butcher dictator like Russia’s Putin…

trump (and republicans) - using the Nazi playbook:

**“Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.”**—Adolf Hitler

1264.) Hell, I can't help but wonder when he's ever read 4 pages of anything.
1265.) I heard nothing was conclusive
1266.) The Mueller Report is the most anticipated report of it's kind in my lifetime. I can't imagine e the US public NOT getting access to it in it's entirely. Unthinkable. 
1267.) hahahahaha!!!!! never!!!!! dude is dumber than rocks. no offense rocks.
1268.) People are often too hard on Trump, but I am going to allow this burn because it is classy to criticize another person for not reading.  
1269.) "Fucking's legal. Selling's legal. Why isn't selling fucking legal?" - George Carlin.
1270.) I think that this will lead to even more exploitation of women and violence. I am open to better informed people as to the human trafficking part and subsequent affects. I also have a young daughter and anything that increases, rather than decreases the objectification of women (and men) is a bad thing to me. Am i wrong on this?
1271.) Anything made illegal forces them to be controlled by criminal organizations. When you make them legal society controls the safety. 

Just like alcohol and abortion. Sex work will always exist, making it legal removes the criminal controls, and helps keep sex workers safe. 
1272.) yes. next question.
1273.) Obstruct justice much?
1274.) What is so bad in those taxes? I mean will it really destroy his whole facade if people know he’s not a billionaire? It seems like that isn’t worth this level of crazy. 
1275.) Trump - Nothing to hide the Mueller report clears me,

The people - Can we see it?

Trump - No.

The people - Can we see your tax returns

Trump - No I'm under audit,

The people - But you've been under audit since before you were president?

Trump - And?

The people - are you lying?

Trump - look over there we're being invaded by thousands of Immigrants at the border!

And so it continues 
1276.) Gee ya think?
1277.) Is the lawyer a 13 yr female?
1278.) Most likely 
1279.) What’s he hiding?  
1280.) The USA is a pathetic joke. 
1281.) Why wouldnt he? He knew this was going to happen since day one. 
Wouldnt Alan Weiselburg have copies?
Ask Michael Cohen who else has copies.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.....HIDE NOTHING.
2020VOTE!2020VOTE!
Need to get ass kissing Mitch out too.
Again VOTE 2020/VOTE2020!
1282.) Let’s be honest, there’s no evidence for it. This article is just an excuse to put “Trump” and “grooming” in the same sentence.
1283.) No lol 
1284.) He’s right but of course the outrage squads won’t listen. My biggest nightmare is any viable candidate to beat Trump gets torn to shreds by the purity patrol while Trump stays on the sideline laughing and coasts to victory. Biden is not my choice but watching the feeding frenzy over what even his accusers agree is not harassment is a preview of what is likely going to be a really ugly primary. We need to make sure that in our quest for progressivism we don’t forget that 1.) there is no such thing as a perfect candidate and 2.) absolutely none of the progressive agenda will be advanced if Trump wins. There is a strain of progressive that won’t accept anything less than 100% adherence to the party line and this thinking will absolutely get Trump re-elected if it’s not checked
1285.) It's very very simple you vote whoever you want in the primary to be the candidate. Then in the general you go and vote Democratic candidate. 

If your ideal candidate is the democratic candidate good for you else suck it up and vote democrat anyway. 

Remember if you don't vote D this time it is likely notorious RBG will retire and they get another asshole on the supreme court and it will be your fault for not voting Democrat.
1286.) Liberals are so self dividing, this coming election will surly be the downfall of the USA. 
1287.) Oh..gee...I wonder what this will be? Clearly not some BS political stunt. My guess is that it will be Hillary Clinton and Obama 8 times. 


...but her emails?!!!
1288.) So are memes the new panem et circenses of our times?
1289.) What a horrendous take on literally everything
1290.) We can't meme? Wtf? I beg to differ:

https://imgur.com/a/f2y8qeU?
1291.) Can't *imagine* why.


1292.) Obviously it's because he wants the IRS to wrap up their witch hunt audit of him and his businesses so he can *finally* release his tax returns to the public. Precedent Trump is nothing if not transparent.
1293.) Strange stuff going on here... hmmm... maybe we should start an investigation?
1294.) Career criminals doing what career criminals do. 
1295.) How very GANGSTER of him!
And predictable. Sad. The whole world should bow at his feet and never help with doing anything that makes him look stupid. Every move he makes says look at me, look at me, I am guilty of everything you think I've done!
1296.) **trumpleThinSkin’s impeachable offenses - and/or Crimes Against Humanity:**

1297.) Hmm... I wonder why...
1298.) The USA is a pathetic joke. 
1299.) Love him! I’ve always been a Bernie guy, even before Bernie was a thing. And now I’m leaning to Mayor Pete, I think he has the best chance at not only beating Trump, but I think he can genuinely bring the country together, and also get progressive policies enacted. 
1300.) I'm a huge supporter of Pete Buttigieg. The thing I like about him the most is that it is clear he's thought long and hard about his policies. He has strong progressive views, but instead of using the normal soundbites and rhetoric, he explains how we can get on the right path to achieve these progressive reforms.
1301.) Listening to mayor Pete is like listening to Obama. He talks in a straight line and when he's finished, you feel like you've learned something. So -SO opposite of listening to people who cover their agenda with smoke-screens of fear-mongering and demonizing.
1302.) My top choice is Inslee, the main reason being how experienced he is in touting the progressive agendas we are rallying behind. He has accomplished a lot both as a Representative and as Governor. [This list starts to give a really good idea](https://politicalcharge.org/2019/04/05/jay-inslee-the-7-issues-guide/) but one thing also not listed was all that Inslee has done as governor in regard to immigrants and refugees including standing up for welcoming Syrian refugees and being the first to sue over the Trump administration over the Muslim ban (and going to the airport right when the families were being separated). He's also protested and fought against ICE practices. I know we're interested in new and interesting, and Pete has a lot of great qualities. While we're looking at dark horse candidates you would be hard pressed not to also give a good look at Inslee.           

&#x200B;

That said I like Pete and he would be easy for me to rally behind if nominee. I will refrain from saying much other than positives regarding Pete because I'm more interested in talking these candidates up, but he does have a lot going for him; my bottom line is I have watched Inslee's careers for years and I have been super impressed with how he's used his office. 
1303.) I think he and the media is placing too much importance on his Sexuality
1304.) I'm sick of hearing about the new flavor the week 

also, his husband's name is a verb ("Chasten") which is weird

1305.) We're aware of this. 
1306.) :)
1307.) I mean its two sides of the same coin. Its absurd to imagine there arent as many delusional people on the left as there are on the right.
1308.) When I think of how close we actually came to having a president who once used a private email server just like her predecessors… I’m like whew, thank goodness we got the racist NRA guy who’s going to bust up the unions, take away peoples healthcare, fleece the treasury, flout the constitution, accuse the media of lying, nepotism, ignore Human-Caused climate change, and give all our military secrets to Russia… wow that was a close one. /s
1309.) To be clear, that's at least 24 whistleblowers. 
1310.) Fox News will somehow spin this to get its idiots all wound up calling the whistleblowers  “traitors” for calling out our hero Donald trump (who totally isn’t a traitor)
1311.) Frankly, anyone who isn’t is a fascist, traitor, or compliant to the point where they are indistinguishable and they need to be barred from public service for the rest of their life.
1312.) I can only get so excited
1313.) I love this. I feel like the "bad guy" for saying about a good number of candidates, okay, you're saying all the right things and your heart is in the right place, but you're running for president, not applying for an internship at a small nonprofit. This especially holds true if the candidate also has very little experience so there isn't much precedent to go off.  The more a candidate has a track record of getting good things done, the more I can at least expect what their specifics will look like.

This challenge to demand details and realism is what distinguishes candidates like Inslee, Castro, Harris,  Warren, and Gillibrand, and currently they just aren't getting the press because they aren't rock stars as much on the podium as much as they are diligent workers in their public offices. Because they can't dedicate as much to just prancing on a podium, and rather they are weaving their campaigning in with their daily work campaigning for the here-and-now issues. The fear is how we falsely equate details and realism with bold ideas - it's not either/or especially in this crowded field. We can have both, and why shouldn't we?
1314.) Papa Bernie can fix all of our problems tho if we just vote hard enough for him!

(For the record I would vote for Bernie, but I just have to roll my eyes at some of his true believers).
1315.) I find your mention of FDR to be incredibly ironic.

&#x200B;

Also, not that you asked, but 'Economics in One Lesson' is a good read. I was going to link to it but I'm certain you would be offended to shop from any of the online retailers where the book is most readily available.
1316.) There are several areas in which profit motive is at best corrupt and at worst abominable, number one among them and definitely of the latter is the caging of human beings.
1317.) The Facebook stories about this story on mainstream news sites are all full of comments like “Hurr, durr, prisons aren’t supposed to be country clubs!” and “If you don’t like it don’t commit crimes!”

I weep for humanity.
1318.) Alabama IS a violation of the Constitution. 
1319.) The Supreme Court just ruled torture is permissible.
1320.) *sweet home Alabama*
1321.) I like National Scotch Day better. 
1322.) How about we see the tax returns of every Supreme Court justice? Their clerks? Every senator and representative? Their staffs & interns? And yes - every president, cabinet member, executive branch employee, etc. 

That would be a great world to live in. Let them all bask (or shrivel) in the sunlight. Smells like freedom!
1323.) That sign in Daley Plaza said *Not Poland but Germany* so it looks like thay were protesting Poland paying reparations and saying Germany should.  I don't see any signage about anti anything except money.  If there had been signage that was anti- semitic then that gathering in Daley Plaza would have had a counter protest.
1324.) NSZ arm bands does not mean antisemitism at least in World War 2. The National Armed Forces weren’t antisemitic. 

In The war, there were dozens of Jewish officers in their ranks. In January 1945, they liberated 280 Jewish women slated for death from Holysov. 

In the post war period they fought against the Communists and did kill several hundred to a thousand Jewish partisans, but from what u understand, the Stalinist forces built some partisan groups of different ethnic groups. In other words, it’s a consequence of the particular soviet informal military unit they fought and not part of ethnic or religious conflict. 

No idea about these dudes. They opposed a bill. Maybe they did it because they are racist. Not enough info in the article to prove it, especially since their NSZ stuff was, frankly, a lie. 
1325.) Opposing a racist bill that breaks American, Polish and international laws and deals - what's anti-Semitic in that, again?
1326.) [deleted]
1327.) **Neo-nazi's trying to rewrite history** https://medium.com/the-method/white-supremacists-are-creating-alternate-history-486903c747a3

**Neo-Nazi LIES** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_negationism

“*These are radical islamic terrorists and she [Hillary] won't even mention the word, and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism,*’” trump said during the Oct. 9 debate

Hey trump; Can you say **Radical Right-Wing Terrorists**?

1328.) Oy vey!
1329.) The article says this like I'm not already fully aware just how many Neo Nazis have sprung up in the U.S.
1330.) On one hand I'm glad all this bullshit is coming out so we can see it, maybe deal with it. On the other I'm shocked by the residual hate, fear and ignorance in the US. I had no illusions that racism was dead when Obama was elected, but god damn seems like 40% of this country is outta their minds.
1331.) This protest is regarding JUST Act 447 [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/447](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/447)

Let me ask you:

What happens to heirless property in your country?

Would you like to have a foreign country coercing your country to decide what will happen to heirless property in your country?
1332.) Trump overwrote security officials when giving a high security clearance to some drug addict., I can’t wait till we find out who that was.

Easy guess would be Steve Banon.. but I’m hoping is someone more juicy like Ivanka or Kushner.. they seem like undercover addicts with daddy issues 
1333.) If you are a conservative, take a breath and think about what you would say if Obama or Hillary did this. 
1334.) Of course he did.  Trump is a traitor.

Destroying American national security is his primary purpose.

1335.) "No puppet. No puppet. You're the puppet!" -DJT
1336.) The us government is a pathetic joke. 
1337.) They don't want anyone convicted of domestic violence charges to lose out on the opportunity to buy a gun. Think of the gun lobby's feelings!  A gun manufacturer may go home with a few dollars less and cry. 
1338.) [deleted]
1339.) First take the healthcare, then take away food stamps, WIC can get erased as well. Hell, let's just do Away with minimum wage and turn the shitty states into sweatshops.
1340.) the only way this should be allowed to happen is if it comes from walmart employees finally being paid enough to feed themselves.
1341.) Impeach this Heartless SOB !
1342.) 750,000 people wasting tax payer dollars that could be used on more productive things.
Did you know that over 200 million dollars of SNAP money stolen from taxpayers is used on fats, candys, and sugars? This could be even higher because not all fatty foods are specifically listed. Love that 200 million dollars going to the 30% obesity rate huh https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/foods-typically-purchased-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap-households
1343.) Seems like a good thing to me. The less folks on food stamps the better imo. Taking personal responsibility for oneself is an important step to get off gubmint hand outs.
1344.) I'm a very, very liberal person but I honestly believe the food stamp system is completely broken. I know a couple of people who make great money, but it's all under the table cash (i.e. tattooist, barbers). A lot of them receive food stamps because they can.
1345.) I say good.   Let it al go to shit it’s the only way to get the idiots who support this asshole and all his complicit GOP thieves to see what they’re all about. And start voting every one of them out.  I say let it happen. 
1346.) Unemployment at an all time low. Let it happen, people are taking responsibility for themselves. 
1347.) Hey but they scored a sporty red ball cap out of the deal and they got to tweak the libs so it's all cool amirite?
1348.) Farm lobby missed the boat on this one years ago. 
1349.) I feel bad for donors. 7 million dollars to a man who will 100% not get nominated? There's already biden, Sanders, warren, Harris, even booker and some guy I've never heard of thinks he has a chance.
1350.) It's pretty clear that Trump is ignorant/insane/in cahoots with Putin.

1351.) Can't *imagine* why a Russian puppet attacks NATO.

Just say the word "traitor" already.  When are we going to stop being sea-lioned by our own leaders, pretending it's an undecided question whether water is wet?
1352.) We know why. Why do we continue to dance around it?
1353.) Putin told him to.  At this point, do you even have to ask?
1354.) His boss doesn’t like NATO
1355.) Russher is the answer
1356.) Daddy Putin doesn't like NATO, that's why. 
1357.) Russia is no longer bolchevik. Time for NATO to go. 
1358.) Funny how the great “art of the deal” guy is the only one, not “a lot of people” or “very, very this or that” who says NATO is a bad deal. Forget the commanders and other foreign leaders, THIS guy, a shitty business man, who we know is doing this for Russia says so and out of his many lies expect us to believe some more.
1359.) Cause we’re being unfairly taxed compared to other country’s
1360.) Found this link on /ARCon

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b80jf1/this\_time\_it\_will\_work/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b80jf1/this_time_it_will_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

The hilarity is in the comments, you should really go and read them.  I can't post to that stoopid fucking sub (been banned, you know, because conservatives ALL support so much free speech).  Basically it goes like this:

1. Original post - banning guns will be as ineffective as banning drugs
2. Comments - we still need to ban drugs

Their hypocrisy knows no bounds.  AND this is a good example of the right-wing propaganda machine.  Conservatives are the ones who ban everything, but they try and message that they want freedoms.
1361.) Cool. Even if this was correct and having guns is bad, which it isn't, when Mr. Sanders comes knocking on our doors to take our guns, 100 million Americans aren't going to give them up so easily. Tyranny is a big threat to our country right now and with no sufficient evidence that gun control works, liberals are digging their own graves.
1362.) This Subreddit is so stupid, I mean Jesus Christ.
1363.) Of course Trump does not care. 
1364.) If we can learn one thing from the Republicans, do not stop pushing until public opinion eventually turns in your favor. But there is one thing different about Democrats. Democrats always fight for what is right for all Americans, whether they are Republican or Democrat.
1365.) The important part of the article:

Enacting a constitutional amendment would be an uphill battle, if not an impossible goal. The amendment would first need to win over two-thirds of both chambers of Congress, and then be ratified by three-fourths of the states.
1366.) Omg it’s like he has been reading all the emails I’ve sent!!
1367.) I know many of you will disagree with me... that being said, abolishing the electoral college is a terrible idea. Without it, rural America has no voice in US politics and all federal policy would be catered toward populous cities. 
1368.) Wokeass merkley 
1369.) Horrible idea. It's part of our government for a reason.
1370.) - when you are so mad trump won you make a bill to get rid of the way he won.

If the tables were flipped, you guys would be worshipping the electoral college. 
1371.) I am not necessarily a liberal, but i do consider my self a democrat, and abolishing the electoral college would be a terrible idea. i know rn most people dont like it, but lets think about the consequences. Without an electoral college, candidates would only campaign in New York, California, Texas and Florida. And they would promise laws that would specifically be favorable in those regions, while ignoring the needs of the other states.
1372.) I Have a better Idea for the EC

Why don't we have popular vote in Congressional Districts

and if you get more then 46 or 47% of the state popular vote you get the 2 votes for the senators seats

Keeping the Electoral College and having people more control on who they elect for president
1373.) Wow this is such great news, now the most populous states (California, New York, etc) will have the most sway in this country, and smaller states will have little to no voice. The Electoral College makes sense because it represents individual counties, if this bill passes then people will be forced to vote with the ideals of their states' largest cities. Rural people need their counties representation, otherwise it will be completely drowned out by urban peoples. The largest states in this country are almost exclusively liberal and will now have almost unlimited momentum going into future elections. For real though, theres a reason why the Electoral College was implemented in the 1700s. As a liberal I cannot support this, its nonsense, the US is massive, the Electoral College wouldn't be needed in a smaller country not divided into states, but with 50 states, the popular vote shouldn't be allowed to dictate the elections. We need to represent everybody and that's why this bill is idiotic. I feel as though my fellow liberals only want this because it ensures our continual domination in future elections, this kind of thinking is wrong and borderline insidious. I'm ashamed that my home state of Colorado is at the forefront of this bs. 

Edit: The Electoral College was established in 1804 not the 1700s.
1374.) Don't forget that Lincoln won because of the electoral college. He lost the overall popular vote!  
1375.) Does he honestly think Trump, the guy who won only because of the electoral college will sign it into law?

Still love you Jeff
1376.) I can't wait for presidential campaigns to only go to 4 states
1377.) What’s the reason for this? Because Hillary lost last election?
1378.) The fucken cops needed a vacation. That’s how they schedule vacations.
1379.) And yet somehow there won’t be enough evidence to convict. Or prosecutors will find credible reason to fear for their life. These cops need MURDER CHARGES.
1380.) Those scandalous pigs. 
1381.) Where’s the second amendment crowd?
1382.) Straight up over kill. Obviously they didnt need to shoot him, but if anything he closest officer could have shot his arm or hand and then just pulled him out the car. 
1383.) For anyone who thinks there aren’t  conservatives with you on this:

1385.) US custody = concentration camps
1386.) lock him up, lock him up
1387.) this is the same guy who called Michael cohen a "rat" for testifying against him. hes fucking hiding things in there. how the fuck haven't we gotten to the finances yet is beyond me
1388.) Gee, why doesn't he just really get down to his natural level and double-dog dare them to look? Sheesh. I've seen pufferfish handle themselves better in the face of adversity. 
1389.) New York prosecutors: "Go ahead punk, make my day."
1390.) fuck that fat orange fuck
1391.) Does Trump think he's in the presidential remake of godfather or something? NY prosecutors don't give a shit. 
1392.) Which is precisely what you'd expect an innocent man to do amirite?
1393.) ###**JUST DO IT!!!**
1394.) He cannot do anything about it. They are New York and not Federal.
1395.) I know why this would be a red line for Trump. Take away his money and what has he got. Sure, he's got power while he's president, but I'm pretty sure his "friends" aren't drawn to him because of his charming personalit. Without money, he'd be nothing.
1396.) Lock his Crooked Ass up !
1397.) Cross that line MF
1398.) The red line was made up by the New York Times and was something Trump barely acknowledged in an interview when the NYT reporters volunteered it. NYT has run countless articles since about "Trump's red line", a concept wholly invented by them. 

Stop perpetuating NYT's bullshit.
1399.) When he dies the world will be a better place.
1400.) the this american life episode from last Sunday about jones is just jaw-dropping. he's a total piece of shit riling up even more pieces of shit to do his bidding. fuck this guy. sue him out of existence.  
1401.) I bet he shit his pants when the plantiffs lawyer backed him into a corner
1402.) **trump and his supporters Antisocial Personality Disorder (Sociopath)**

Symptoms Antisocial personality disorder (Mayo Clinic) signs and symptoms may include:

- Disregard for right and wrong
- Persistent lying or deceit to exploit others

- Being consistently irresponsible and repeatedly failing to fulfill work or financial obligations
1403.) He’s a PoS.
1404.) Lil bitch boy 
1405.) What a vile, disturbed man who stirs up other vile, disturbed people who then traumatise grieving parents. What an absolute shit-stain this guy is.
1406.) Conservative here. I'm pretty sure everyone on our side also agrees, this man is a lunatic.
1407.) I am just drained by this.  When is it gonna be over for f..k sake!!!!!
1408.) Why are there over 300 pages of details about something that didn't happen?
1409.) He's the absolute master of projection. No contest.

I've been filled with anger and misery ever since the report released and Barr gave his shitty summary he actually expected the American people to accept.
1410.) He literally gets away with shit and then accuses his accusers of his own crimes.  The level of  shameless Teflon  deflection  is almost impressive.  
1411.) I wish he would go away.

He's a thug.  Waving white power signs around on national TV. It was no accident.

He needs to be stopped.
1412.) Projection. 
1413.) Black Mirror, the insights of the entire show is impressive.
1414.) I don’t think he even knows what treason means?

“Oh they’re saying I committed treason?! Better say they are too!”

Literally everything he is accused of and most likely did do, he accuses back at the dems to try and take the heat away from himself. 

This man is mentally unstable. 
1415.) trumps standard defence tactic to accuse the opposition of what you are doing.


Did you do that?, no you did it! just like a five year old.



1416.) Just agree with him and call for the perpetrators to be removed from office. Republicans are the ones that started and carried out the investigation. So, dissolve the Republican Party.
1417.) If you ever want to know what the Republicans are doing just listen to what they accuse the left of doing. 
1418.) I think it's time for someone to sue for Libel. Then Trump has to put up or shut up (and lose some cash).
1419.) Gigity gigity goo
1420.) Epic
1421.) It’s difficult to distance oneself from their own shadow. 
1422.) If he did his rallies would be empty
1423.) Has he distanced himself at all?
1424.) [deleted]
1425.) You mean at all.
1426.) Did Hillary distance herself from the KKK legend?
1427.) Every company, person, entity has to connect to the public telephone utility.  Wouldn't it be easy to force these customers to register every phone number they will spoof and limit their spoofing to only those numbers?  That way, any given phone number can be traced back to the customer.

Of course, I am not a telephone technology guy, but it seems a simple solution to me.  Thoughts?
1428.) What the hell is wrong with these people?
1429.) In Russia
1430.) This is udder nonsense. Devin is a cow-erd. He should really end his beef with Twitter.

And now here's a hilarious video about what a truly horrible person Devin Nunes is: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co1M0oHP8qI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co1M0oHP8qI)
1431.) The ABSOLUTE BEST that a lot of these lower-profile players in this mess (Nunes, Gates, Papadopoulos, etc) can hope for is that they will be utterly forgotten by history, because if they do make it into the history books, it will not be kind.

Guys like Trump and Flynn and Manafort on the other hand, will have several generations of offspring over the next century or two who spend their entire life sheepishly lying to everyone they meet, "Haha, no, no relation to THAT guy. . ."
1432.) His parody accounts certainly will be, not sure about him though....
1433.) Doubt it.
1434.) Doubtful...
1435.) He is just saying bullshit that he knows will cause outrage.  I'm not giving him the satisfaction.
1436.) Well if the revisionist history books keep finding their way into classrooms, he very well may be.
1437.) Uh yeah - right up there with Benedict Arnold
1438.) To the white hoods, maybe. 
1439.) Fucking traitors all of them. 
1440.) In a dictatorship, the ruling party gets to decide who the heroes are 
1441.) By country bumpkins maybe. 
1442.) God I loathe this woman. 
1443.) I want to let her do it. She couldn't answer an elected rep. on how many kids that would affect. The elected rep. being an educated person did their homework prior to the meeting and new the answer. 280,000 kids. It is time to give the american people some tough love. Let the Republicans win on what they want to do. Let her cut it. Parents of 280K kids will suddenly have that pulled from under them. Maybe they will wake up and realize Republicans are ***only*** out for the super wealthy and in no way whatsoever here for anyone else. Let them win, let the people suffer. let them cancel obamacare. It is counter intuitive but yes, let them burn the house down. Then simply go on the road and say I told you this would happen to you and they are the ones that did it. Do you want us to fix it? Or do you want the house to continue to burn?
1444.) Betsy DeVos (trump’s Secretary of Education)

- Billionaire
- No education degree
- No teaching experience
- Republican Sociopath
- No experience working in a school environment
- Never attended public school or state university
- Never put her own children in public school
- Does not believe in or support public education
- Believes public school teachers are overpaid
- Supports for-profit education
- Invested $200 million in Christian schools and organizations
- Doggedly advocates funneling money out of public education and into for-profit Christian-based education
1445.) I think this creature is even more evil than her brother. Her brother? Blackwater founder, human rights violater, war criminal, and religious zealot Erik Prince, who has openly stated he wants to start a new round of Crusades in order to trigger Armageddon.
1446.) She is evil
1447.) Getting the private sector/donations to raise $18 Million but to hear a woman worth $2 Billion say that we need to cut a program worth $18 Million because we have a larger defecit because of Trump's bullshit is amazing. Also her yacht is worth like $40 Million and doesn't even pay property tax because it's registered under the Cayman Islands (and gets free protection from the Coast Guard)
1448.) She’s probably bitter she got cut from the Special Olympics basketball team as a child.
1449.) What a feckless 
1450.) Scum of the universe. 
1451.) Trump countermanded her and has thrown her under the bus. I imagine she'll resign by the end of next month. Trump hates when underlings make him look bad, and she's done this in spades.
1452.) Maybe unpopular opinion here but does this really need to be federally funded?  We couldn't drum up funding for this voluntarily?

Like no one (outside of DeVos, apparently) wants to be perceived in opposition to the disabled.  But it is a little weird that this isn't a non-profit type deal, or am I crazy?
1453.) [We already spend more than most of the Western world on education, per student](https://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/sep/21/donald-trump/trump-us-spends-more-almost-any-other-major-countr/). Maybe it wouldn't kill us to be like Europe and spend less. The Special Olympics are a wonderful charity, but the government has no business funding them any more than it has business funding the make a wish foundation.
1454.) It'd certainly also possibly undermine the influences of class differences if the rich were forced to have their little silver spoons attend the same school as at least middle class students. A few generations of sharing the same misery and possibly making friends over that misery with people of different social classes might help these kids grow up to be not as huge assholes as their parents.

Then again one can never underestimate teenagers to latch onto the least excuse to segregate themselves. But it's worth a shot? At the very least it'd mean that those parents would pitch in more money if it's the situation their children have to endure.
1455.) As well he should be - we the people are sick of his shit
1456.) **V O T E** 

Republicans are COWARDS

 - If trump was a democrat, republicans would have already impeached him…
1457.) Vote the dog shit out of government. 
1458.) Time to put Mitch in a zoo. 
1459.) The article mentions promoting online voting, so I'm just going to leave [this](https://xkcd.com/2030/) here.
1460.) Kentucky if you're here, it's all on you to get rid of that hamster. 
1461.) r/fuckmitchmcconnell 
1462.) Someday, people are going to tell horror stories about Trump in order to scare their kids into voting.
1463.)  I never use cussing in 22 years - but the gloves are off. Listen you son of a bitch. What the fuck's your problem? You wanna sit here and say that I'm a goddamn fucking Russian? You get in my face with that I'll beat your goddamn ass you son of a bitch. You piece of shit. You fucking goddamn fucker. Listen fuckhead, you've fucking crossed the line. Get that through your goddamn fucking head. Stop pushing your shit. You're the people who've fucked this country over and gangraped the shit out of it and lost an election, so stop shooting your mouth off claiming that I'm the enemy. You got that you goddamn son of a bitch. Fill your hand, I'm sorry but I'm done. You start calling me a foreign agent, those are fucking fighting words, excuse me.﻿ 
1464.) Ditch the Mitch!
1465.) I honestly think there are 100 people driving the entire political banter on the internet and people just vote against whatever side pissed them off last time. 
1466.) He’s had a long career, I don’t think he’s scared of retirement
1467.) No it isn't and no he isn't.

Now please prove me wrong!
1468.) Tax cuts come at a cost. 
1469.) That's not her real nose. 
1470.) Anyone who just assumes their vote won’t matter from now on should be ashamed of themselves.  We need to take it all back and right now before these lunatics ruin our country forever. 
1471.) Am I the only one that would NEVER want a house that friggin big? I have a 3bed 1.5 bath and can't seem to keep the damn place clean as it is. Give me a normal persons home, some land and a garage full of toys to enjoy.

Then again, she probably has a dozen staff to maintain the house.
1472.) Hope the Amway sheep are proud
1473.) Stop the presses - a rich person has a large house and expensive boat!?
1474.) Hey Red Hat Cult hows that tax cut looking? 
1475.) So what is that, about $4 per American per month? I'd rather us not do business with a nation that doesn't believe in rights, than get that money back. Keep tariffs on China indefinitely.
1476.) Isn't this the county that had large amounts ballot integrity problems?
1477.) Wait, why would a ballot be rejected? Oh, because they voted Democrat, got it. Healthy system we got.
1478.) Apparently this is pretty common in Florida, it's obviously targeting young people. That law really needs to be taken out. 
1479.) If it were some third world country, US would have asked for a UN Observer to oversee the election process.
1480.) I've always thought the map shown in the picture was very disingenuous. Makes you think the country is 95% Republican. The truth is that most of the population are in cities in the blue areas, while a vast expanse of the red area is mostly jackrabbits and coyotes.   
1481.) Sure, this skyscraper that holds 100,000 people voted for democrats. But these 13 fields that mah dog lives in votes for republicans. So the country’s republican. /s for those who didn’t catch on.
1482.) Hahahahahaha. GOOD LUCK.
1483.) For one, it’s a non-profit. That’s a good start, they have no one to be loyal to but themselves. Second, it’s a wire service. So it tends to be straight reporting of the facts. Their job is to report the facts on any given news story, and then your news org is welcome to add comment and spin.
1484.) It's a pretty standard no-nonsense organization, similar to NPR. I know some of their reporters are fantastic, but most are probably pretty average...they do straight news, very few opinion pieces. I wonder why the downvoted for this submission? Wrong topic?
1485.) Yeah that AP News app is my primary source of news. It's the most objective source I'm aware of. It can actually be pretty boring to read but I guess that's what non-sensationalized facts are like. Plus the app is totally free.
1486.) Media Bias Fact Check site lists them as among the least biased. [https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/)

The other thing to keep in mind is that most news agencies get stories directly from AP and they're not edited either. 
1487.) Very conservative as conservative as Fox news, just less inflammatory. 
1488.) To this court? No. You could pass pretty much any voting restriction you want and they would find some way to sweep it under the rug.
1489.) Nope. SCOTUS isn't legitimate anyways, so don't expect anything from this fascist rubber-stamp committee.

If trump's verbatim admissions that he targeted Muslims wasn't enough to strike down his illegal Muslim ban, then nothing can possibly matter to these traitors.
1490.) Republicans are probably going to Republican.
1491.) No
1492.) Please man. Just stop. 
1493.) Wow get over it trump didn't collude. It's just like when Obama was president and all the right wing loonies said he wasn't a us citizen and wanted to see his birth certificate! Collusion is just a bullshit conspiracy theory the Democrats used to help them win the mid terms and now it is backfiring on them
1494.) What most people in the left don't seem to get...the more energy you spend chasing ghosts and shadows the less energy you have to actually do anything.  
1495.) Man, you just cant let it go can you?
1496.) Give up, dude.
1497.) Legally speaking, 'collusion' doesn't exist.  Only criminal conspiracy. And I think Barr is playing fast and loose with the spin, as we all expected he would.
1498.) Muller: There is no evidence of Collusion.

This guy: So there was Collusion. 
1499.) [removed]
1500.) Republicans are the scum of the universe. 
1501.) It's a good start!
1502.) Fucking Repugnicants!

&#x200B;
1503.) Just watched a few of these videos - definitely worth your time.  Good stuff, well done.
1504.) Shortly after it was released, I watched the one on them being bad faith debaters and instantly recognized the entirety of the lead up to the 2016 elections, and frankly that's all I needed to see from this channel. I mean it's probably a great channel and people should support it, but I just don't need to know anything beyond the fact that there's no point in engaging them at all. Just focus on convincing the independents and non-voters that being engaged can fix this shit show. 
1505.) Thank you for this! I recently posted a question about getting along with my conservative coworkers and wound up getting mostly backlash and not a lot of helpful comments. I’ve been trying to understand conservative motivations better and this was really helpful.
1506.) Great video - thanks for sharing 
1507.) Right after I saw that episode, I decided to post it to /r/Conservative as a sort of olive-branch; IDK whether they'll approve the post but here it is anyway: https://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b4o8ci/the_altright_playbook_always_a_bigger_fish_a/
1508.) The video has a good premise but it uses  the terms alt-right and conservatives together as synonymous. Actual conservatives feel that the alt-right is fascist and therefore more liberal than conservative. 

If your “conservative” friend marched in Richmond then you can apply this information. Otherwise if they are an actual conservative then the information in the video is nowhere near accurate and does not apply 

Hope this helps in your conversations with conservatives
1509.) Maybe I’m misunderstanding, but the difference between racial ideology and racial identity seems to be a distinction without a difference. 

The last paragraph of the article, “What this all shows is that America isn’t racially divided, it’s divided by racial ideology. And that’s a good thing for the country’s unity, because ideological differences, however lamentable, are less polarizing than racial conflict, in which whole communities mobilize against an enemy. A mix of races are found in each racial ideology, preventing tribe and creed from pushing in the same direction, which might lead to civil conflict. This raises the hope that American political elites can one day heal the country’s divisions.”

Nazism is clearly an ideology, but it still resulted in the Holocaust.  How, exactly, is ideology less polarizing?
1510.) I kind of agree, everyone hates each other at this point. Its getting worse and worse, I honestly think the US should just break up. California being its own country would be fantastic. California, Nevada, Hawaii, Washington, would be amazing. Joining Canada would be a dream. 

Federal politics just don't seem sustainable, they used to pretend to try to get along and had some joint efforts, that is long gone. 
1511.) Cool, as long as red states tax money stayed in red states. 
1512.) Because a lot of people would suffer. And the red states likely wouldn't care. 
1513.) Well I heard a segment about this on NPR and I think such a thing, which might be satisfying a little in a Schadenfreude or just desserts way, isn't really what we want. The Democratic party is trying to reach people in all 50 states. Let's stop dividing the country into concepts of red and blue states, if it implies we don't try to reach anyone outside of "blue". What about swing states? What about the Republican rural parts of blue states like Illinois and California that are only blue because of their cities? We should be trying, hard as it is, to reach all people, including people who have traditionally been Republican. So it would be satisfying but Petty and undermining our long-term goals. 
1514.) [removed]
1515.) Republicans are the scum of the universe. 
1516.) Did this same shit happen in one of the Carolinas? The outgoing ousted governor pulled a typical republican shitbag move to strip the incoming gov of power? 
1517.) They struck it down for the wrong reasons though. The session where all of the activity that stripped his powers was not a normally scheduled session that was done by the procedure outlined in the states constitution. Everything done during that session was rendered null & void, but will be appealed and will most likely be overturned.
1518.) I can’t fathom how anyone can justify this behavior. If this were a Democratic endeavor, conservatives would rightly scream bloody murder. But because so many ignorant souls abide by these antics, it exemplifies that they concur with a oligarchy that does whatever it wants as long as it’s not a Democrat who is doing it.
1519.) This is it. Here we go. I fully expect the AG to redact some of the report and "re-write" whatever he feels necessary to save face with Trump, and save the Trump Admin in whole. This is going to get really interesting for the US really quick.
1520.) What did he conclude?
1521.) Ahh the liberal tears are salty-sweet. 
1522.) Trump bad
1523.) Good job! Mental health is very important and I hate how some people downplay it so they can give themselves an excuse to not give other people help.

Or overplay it to try and get rid of certain rights to people just because they have a mental illness.
1524.) Yes it is.
1525.) this some bulllll
1526.) Last year About $400 Billion was donated to Charities  

Now the tax part on incometax isnt that big of a deal, Avg Tax rate is 15% so 60B in unearned taxes.  You know enough to fund 90% of the cost fully funding college

But that 400 Billion is spent on things in cities and states and as a Non Profit you pay no sales tax on 400 B in spending, of course lets adjust that as sales tax generally only affects on average 33% of income.  So 133B in sales tax Spending at national avg 9.9%.  13 Billion in Sales Tax.  That would go to cities and states to fund higher education, higher teacher salaries, higher police salaries

Amazon aint got nothin on charities,

Like Religion.


1. According to the most recent estimates from Giving USA, Giving to religion totaled $122.94 billion in 2017. 

About 20% of Church funds arent spend in the current year. Church Profit  24.6B

* Corporate Taxes Due $6B
* Corporate Income Taxes Paid - $0

100B in Expenses Taxed at the state(9.9% nationwide Avg) only about  35% of spending gets taxed

* Personnel Income and Expenses Taxes Due $3.5B
* Taxes Collected $0

The Hartford Seminary estimates that there are 335,000 congregation in the US with an average property valued at $2.1M

* Property Tax Owed $32.3 Billion
* Property Taxes Paid $0

The Presbyterian Foundation, which manages $1.9 billion in assets. (2012)

* A $100,000 donation or investment in 1980 with the Foundation 
 * has paid $460,000 in capital gains and 
  * is currently worth $248,000
* Taxes Paid $0

Religions pay no investment taxes (such as capital gains taxes). These can result from surplus cash donations or donations of investment instruments such as stocks.

1527.) I'm deeply disappointed.

I wish I could say "surprised."
1528.) Christian Charity....there’s an Oxymoron for ya. 
1529.) The agreement was that churches are supposed to keep OUT of politics in all forms, and in return they are not taxed.

They've been breaking this contract for decades now and need to be punished harshly. 
1530.) So the largest Christian charity is a supporter of domestic terrorism? Somehow nothing surprises me anymore. That is not a good thing that I'm not surprised.  
1531.) "Donor-advised funds allow individuals sending the tax deductible contributions to remain anonymous from the IRS"  


Creepy.
1532.) Republican Jesus would be so proud. 
1533.) Color me shocked. The American Christian conservative right wing is pretty much already a hate group. But a highly profitable one. 
1534.) I call shenanigans on this. Their source is the Southern Povery Law Center (SPLC).

The SPLC is notorious for labelling those they disagree with as hate groups:

 https://youtu.be/qNFNH0lmYdM



1535.) ...but you repeat yourself.
1536.) FryShocked.jpg
1537.) Scum of the universe. 
1538.) Has similar research been done on Muslim charity groups?  Jewish?
1539.) It is also 'possible' that it was the the devil.
1540.) Hahahahaha  hahahahaha 
1541.) It’s possible that I am actually god, and you should believe me when I say that adulterers should be stoned in the streets. 

Not gays though, that was just some translation bs from the 9-12 dudes who compiled the stories of the bible over a period of 600 years.
1542.) Just try not to place so much importance in people’s political beliefs... 
1543.) It can be hard especially when you have to listen to nonsense and just grit your teeth but that’s what I’d advise you to do. There’s no percentage in trying to use reason with righties. It just doesn’t work. Years ago I had a job where I had to go to prosecutors offices to work on the computers and literally every single one of them had someone with an AM radio tuned to Rush Limbaugh playing all day. They’d nod their head along and talk about how awful the liberals were and I’d have to just keep my mouth shut and ignore it. Luckily I wasn’t stuck there every day - I did my thing and got out. If I did have to listen to that daily I’d invest in a good pair of noise cancelling headphones and just drown it out with some music or a podcast.
1544.) First political conversation I say “I don’t talk politics at work”. 
1545.) Political anonymity in professionalism is not just functional for a work environment, it's functional for Democracy.  Owners and bosses used to force employees to vote their way or get fired.  It's more than just a good thing, it's a necessity in our society.  They should understand this.  Also, don't only hang with people who think exactly like you do all the time.  The probability to learn plummets.  
1546.) Become a master of changing the subject. If your coworker gets onto politics, say you think the politician made a bid on some famous sports team and start talking about that instead.
1547.) Politics shouldn’t have a place at work.  It’s unprofessional.   I’d kindly remind them of that.
1548.) So you're struggling with things like:

&#x200B;

"These people DON'T like to kill babies?"

"These people actually OWN guns?"  
"These people feel there are more ILLEGALS coming in than is necessary?"

"These awful people go to CHURCH! FUCKING CHURCH!"

"These awful people believe in TWO GENDERS! TWO. What kind of IDIOT only feels there are TWO GENDERS?"

"These awful don't feel/think for me. OMG! My life was a LIE! I AM NOT SPECIAL! WHAT!?"

&#x200B;

Suck it up or get a new job, what a tool. 
1549.) Keep in mind, they are probably saying the same thing about you. 
1550.) To the surprise of absolutely nobody.
1551.) "You're lips are moving, but you aren't saying anything."
1552.) Ok so here’s the solution. Subpoena subpoena subpoena. And when they don’t comply contempt of Congress until there is no cabinet.
1553.) "Innovation" is probably the old horse-sh\*t about "clean coal."
1554.) Fits my prediction that once the fossil fuel industry is largely dead, the GOP will start rewriting history and claiming liberals were the ones who stood in the way of addressing climate change.

They lie for pleasure.  So the bigger the lie, the bigger their gratification.
1555.) The innovation the GOP is standing in the way of?  
1556.) Very soon they will have no say at all based on how they have been behaving.
1557.) In other words, the best solution to climate change is now being put forward by Republicans! Now let’s get rid of oil and gas subsidies, and innovation will really take off!
1558.) That's not true at all, The Senate is taking it seriously, I heard they will be bring the Green New Deal to a vote shortly. 
1559.) Here's my take, Pelosi doesn't want to proceed with the articles of impeachment at this point because at this point there is not enough sufficient proof that Trump violated the law to convince the Republican Senate to actually vote to impeach him. If the house were to go ahead with the vote, it passes, goes to the Senate, and gets struck down, it might make future attempts to impeach Trump more difficult even in the face of new evidence or allegations.

I feel like Trump is calling for Muller's report to be made public not only as a false posture of strength, but also because the noose is really tightening in on Trump. If the report were made public right now, Trump might have just enough wiggle room to escape indictment and impeachment. I also feel like if this were to happen it would make other investigations into Trump's affairs, like devaluing assets to evade taxes, lose some public support and really rile up the propaganda machines for the upcoming election.

Overall, it's not that Pelosi is actively defending Trump. She's a politician playing politics. If we weren't so entrenched in party over country politics, the proceedings would probably already be taking place. However we live in a time where the president can pay a pornstar for sex while his wife is pregnant with his child and still get the overwhelming support of the evangelical vote. Unfortunately for the democratic politicians, they have to impatiently wait for Mueller's findings to come out and hope that there is enough public outcry that republican senators start worrying about their job security in future elections if they don't support impeachment. When that happens, republicans will (hopefully) jump ship.

Am I happy about it? No. Do I understand it? Yes.
1560.) I suspect she thinks that Trump as President damages the GOP's 2020 chances far more than Pence as President would.
1561.) She’s not defending Trump. Nowhere in what you quoted is she even hinting at defending him. 

But you do realize that impeachment is just a step in the process? He would have to be convicted by the Senate to be removed from office, and we all know that Republicans are not brave enough to support conviction. If they were, per Pelosi’s quote, you would not be wasting your time, and impeachment would be worth pursuing.

Right now their efforts are best focused on continuing to identify all of the corruption that Trump and co have added to our government agencies, so that when Trump is removed from office—either through conviction or election—the other MAGAts that he brought with him will also be held to account.
1562.) Impeachement is not a legal proceeding.  It is a political one.  And if you shoot for the king, you cannot miss.

Nancy has more political experience than anyone on reddit..*combined*.  If she is saying impeachment would distract the country and give Trump political cover for more fuckery...all the while resulting in no conviction...then I trust her.
1563.) Impeach Trump you get Pence, and with Pence all those conservatives who are on the edge with Trump love Pence, they see him as a moral Christian who looks and acts Presidential, Republicans Know this they will ride it out just until the end then drop the hammer.  
1564.) This was precisely the reason I was against her regaining the speakership. She did the same thing in 2007 with W who clearly had violated the law with Iraq and warrant less wiretapping. Frankly those crimes seem almost quaint now in the Trump era. If we're lucky we'll be rid of Trump in 2021 but very clearly he'll get away with all of this with no consequences and nothing will change to prevent it from happening again.  
1565.) What a shitty job she has. 
1566.) "A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons." —Hillary
1567.) So much of our infrastructure could use that money...this wall is a ridiculous ego trip for this man.
1568.) I hope that republicans are starting to see how mentally ill trump is. He's not only unqualified but he's almost psychotic.

Republicans need to wake up to the fact that they are enabling trumps mental illness by still supporting him.  They would do trump a favor by starting impeachment, which will make trump resign.  

Republicans are COWARDS

 - If trump was a democrat, republicans would have already impeached him…

1569.) If you think the wall is about immigration and not a big payout to some contracting company trump either owes money to or is colluding with, than i have ocean front property in north dakota you might be interested in.
1570.) I don't disagree that the southern border needs some structures and additional funding to help stop drug and human trafficking but this is such an abuse of executive authority and clear example of why the imperial presidency era needs to end.
1571.) Yes, we absolutely do.
1572.) 1 more year guys. Just one.... more.... painful year....
1573.) Once constituents hear how he is gutting projects for their states to pay for wall they gonna be pissed.
1574.) [removed]
1575.) no they don't
1576.) I doubt those poll results, let’s be honest here. Hillary won by big margin by those polls last time. Fact is Trump won the presidency on border wall promise. Country is divided between ‘border wall’ vs ‘no wall’. And yes I do believe there is something going on on the border that need to be fixed. As a country, US has only limited resources. Should we spend those resources on ‘economic opportunity hunters’ or Citizens who fall through a crack and need some help? Please do not tell me taxing billionaires will solve the issue, do your math and you will find out it does not. Just look at the number of people entering illegally every month and if you still think it’s not an issue, then you are so optimistic that you live in a la la land. 
1577.) I always thought that liberals needed to talk to conservatives. 
1578.) In my view, Republicans want to strip rights from my own family, tolerate ideologies of racism and bigotry, dismantle my profession, mandate my religion. I can't possibly vote for a Republican, even if the individual shares mostly similar views, the party does not. 
1579.) I mean if you're a Republican and want a Republican candidate, and that's your only choice I mean...yeah.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
1580.) Steve King doesn't realize what side Iowa was on during the real Civil War, either.
1581.) Not really worried about threats from a pipsqueak Neo NAZI or his army of morbidly obese, type 2 diabetic, rascal scooter bound chickenhawks. 
1582.) And yet he'll still get re-elected for some reason.
1583.) How's that ~~peace in our time~~ "bipartisanship" that Speaker Pelosi keeps talking about coming along, with Nazi trash like Steve King speaking for the zeitgeist on the other side?
1584.) [deleted]
1585.) So what you’re saying is that just like every other geriatric republican boomer on Facebook, he shared a meme without fully understanding what was on it? Shocking. The stupid spreads far and wide like wild fire with these people.
1586.) Probably because Steve King is a moron...and Iowa should stop having morons represent them. 👍
1587.) The next civil war won't be North v South. It'll be Rural vs. Urban. 
1588.) These fucking nazis in our gov have got to go. 
1589.) I wish there were a way we could see his brain so we could study it in order to find out just what the hell is wrong with him.
1590.) He made a disturbing point though that rings true, that they have the guns.
1591.) Fuck this guy and pewdiepie isnt racist 
1592.) Watch Jessica Jones on Netflix !
1593.) Start with the basics. I suggest reading"Delusions of gender" by Cordelia Fine.
1594.) for some primary source documents, see 'The Essential Feminist Reader', which has [blogs](http://feministreaderreview.wordpress.com) about it also.
1595.) There are so many good nonfiction recommendations, here. But I'd also recommend two fiction works: author Yaa Gyasi's Homegoing and Amy Reed's The Nowhere Girls. I am American so these are American-centric, but they cover rape culture and racism against africans/African Americans/blacks. Topics I am very passionate about under the realm. Feminism is the cure to many awful things in the world. Good luck, it'll take a big heart and a long time to "get it."
1596.) Faces of Feminism by Sheila Tobias.
The beauty myth by Naomi Wolf.
The Awakening and selected stories of Kate Chopin.
Reviving Ophelia.


1597.) I feel like the best place to start for   historical context might be Emma Goldman, as a lot of her work influenced social justice during the early 1900s.
1598.) If you're at University, I recommend taking Women and Gender studies classes for the most comprehensive approach. Of course, school is expensive, so if that's not an option...

Here are some classics:

The Second Sex by Simone De Beauvour

Women, Race, and Class by Angela Davis

Anarchism and Other Essays by Emma Goldman

Sister Outsider by Audre Lorde

There are a lot of new feminist books coming out all the time, though they tend to be about very specific nuanced topics within feminism, like sexual politics, bias in the Medical industry, and the promotion or critique of marketplace feminism- so you might want to save these for after you've gotten a strong foundation. Even though some of these books are over 50 to 100 years old, you might be shocked by how little the culture has changed and how relevant so many of these issues still are today. 
1599.) What’s “she’s beautiful when she’s angry” it’s a great film about the rise of feminism 
1600.) I read bell hooks’ Feminism is for Everybody a few years into my feminist journey and I wish it had been my first introduction into feminism. It gives a bit of historical context and gives a beautiful analysis of the movement and why it’s important.

Lots of love to you on your feminist journey! 
1601.) An easy place to start is with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s speech/essay “We Should All Be Feminists”. From there, bell hooks.
1602.) There's a really great HBO movie about the suffragettes called "Iron Jawed Angels." 
1603.) Jessica Valenti - Full Frontal Feminism. And she has a lot of other recent books as well. Great for young women on learning why feminism matters.
1604.) This is awesome! I’ll be saving a lot of these suggestions as well :) 
1605.) This may be a later stage for ya but I believe The Handmaids Tale (both book & show on Hulu) is incredibly important in our political landscape. It seems far fetched, but if you examine where we are now, it doesn’t seem like it couldn’t happen. 
1606.) Thanks everyone! Looks like it will be a long jorney for me but I'm super excited!! Please keep add comments for people who is like me :) I gotta go and made a list haha
1607.) It's awesome you're interested! 
Look at the Ted Talk called The sexy lie with Caroline Heldman. It's short and simple and really good to get a basic view of the society :) 

1608.) I highly recommend watching CNN's documentary, *The Seventies:* episode 6 "Battle of the Sexes."  It gives great insight into women's struggle for equal rights during that era. Compelling footage and great series!

Edit: wording.
1609.) Welcome. Glad you want to learn.

Herstory is important.   If the documentary “She’s Beautiful When She’s Angry” is still on Netflix, watch that.

Andrea Dworkin is a tough but tonic read. I recommend “Right-Wing Women”, particularly the chapter on “The Promise of the Ultra-Right.”  

https://feminist-reprise.org/library/ is a good collection of radical resources.

These are favorites of mine but there are other fine recommendations on this thread. You will quickly discover the many strains of thought and lines of fissure. It is an enriching undertaking. Good luck.


1610.) In grad school I took a course called the History of Feminism.  It was great for this exact reason.  Here are the must reads off the top of my head: 

- This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color.  Edited by Cherríe Moraga & Gloria Anzaldúa.  This is a collection of writings that was published in the 1981 and became one of the cited works in feminist theory. Very influential. 

- Gender and the Politics of History by Joan W Scott.  This book is heavy theory on gender and history and is EXCELLENT!  It is dense, but really good.  There are also lots of YouTube conversations with Joan W Scott.  She is awesome.  

1611.) Also, agree on anything bell hooks.  Also check out Black Feminist Thought by Patricia Hill Collins if you are interested in this area of feminism.   
I quickly learned that the history of feminism has be told through the lens of those in power, so it’s important to seek out writers from marginalized groups.  
1612.) I would highly recommend the Essential Feminist Reader. It has excerpts from a lot of different texts, some of which have already been mentioned here. It's a great starting point because it gives you a general overview of the history of Feminism and its big players.
1613.) [removed]
1614.) [http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Feminism\_101](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Feminism_101)
1615.) There are some great TED talks out there - check out Laura Bates (founder of the every day sexism website) and then on YouTube you can go from there in the "watch next".
1616.) Kudos to you for wanting to learn more about feminism! Feminist theory is also great for training your mind on how to dissect issues beyond gender-related ones. If you're in college, taking a class is the easiest way to go about it. Feminism is also a huge area of scholarship, so I suggest that once you've built some background in the basics, look into where feminism overlaps with issues that you particularly care about so that you don't get lost.

To build understanding of key concepts in feminism I'd take a look at **1)** This paper by Kimberle Crenshaw who coined the term "intersectionality" which is now widely used, not just in feminism but in many social justice discussions: *Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics* **2)** "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House" by Audre Lorde in her book *Sister Outsider* **3)** F*eminism is for everyone* by bell hooks **4)** Any reader from an introductory Gender and Women's Studies college level class. 

If you become really interested in feminist theory, you will realize that many academic feminists always take into account post-colonialism, Orientalism, eurocentrism, imperialism, transnational feminism, etc. These concepts are core to feminist studies. Don't be intimidated if you're not familiar with them (take your time to learn what they mean + why they're important) but do realize that understanding these terms will make you realize that feminism is never just about gender - it's about race, class, ethnicity, economics, commoditization, his(her)story as much as it is about gender. You will realize why feminist history never ever just begins with "first-wave feminism" which is a typical "white feminist" mistake to make. Keep an open mind and have fun learning!
1617.) A great place to start would be Samantha bees hit comedy show full frontal
1618.) If you’re interested in the historic background, I highly recommend “Sisterhood is Powerful”, which is a really good intro to 1960s second-wave feminism, with a lot of varied essays that help to show how feminism really expanded past the very suffrage-based first wave
1619.) [One of my most favourite TedTalks, about why we should be  feminists](https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_we_should_all_be_feminists?nolanguage=e&utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare)
1620.) “The creation of Patriarchy” by Girda Lerner is an absolutely perfect way to start. Its old, its dry, but it is packed with so much important information and perspective.   The most fundamental definition of feminism is the belief that women are humans and deserve to be treated this way... a belief in the need for equity between the sexes; politically, socially, and economically.  Women have progressed through history by continuing to say “no, we aren’t there yet” and not allowing oppression to be defined by those in positions of privilege.  

—I would like to add, this is an intersectional movement.  Feminism is just a glorious piece of the Human Rights movement. Feminism must include women of color, and transgender women, women from all religious and cultural backgrounds. “We cannot succeed when half of us are held back.”- Malala Yousafzi
1621.) You should read something about the relation between feminism and socialism too, since feminism is a social struggle (and the bourgeois women are not affected by the problems worker women are exposed). I need to read more about feminism and the working class but I have some texts, for example "Woman and Socialism" by August Bebel (1876),  Women's Suffrage and Class Struggle by Rosa Luxemburg (1912)
1622.) Hello! Judith Butler is a pioneer in feminist critique theory - I suggest you start with Gender Trouble. Good way to get you a perspective on the theory. Dual systems feminist theory is also the one I subscribe to the most. 
1623.) Read feminist  mystique and take some women studies courses if you can especially ones dealing with feminism. I am currently in a feminist theory course. 
1624.) [removed]
1625.) You just need to read "The Second Feminist Wave" by Lear (1968)! https://www.nytimes.com/1968/03/10/archives/the-second-feminist-wave.html
1626.) start by reading more about [how to make birth control greener,](http://damsel.typepad.com/damsel/2009/07/please-dont-green-our-birth-control.html) one of the trending topics on twitter right now
1627.) On the science fiction side I’d like to suggest anything by Sheri S.  Tepper. ‘The Gate to Women’s Country’ is a great place to start but really anything she writes is a great way to get a different perspective and enjoy a great read. 
1628.) Looking into the Sacred Feminine and the Divine Feminine for its historical context is an important first step.
1629.) Truly shocked that nobody has mentioned Mary Wollstonecraft, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Ida B Wells.....
1630.) For intersectional feminism (eg: feminism), I'd also recommend following some educators on social media and elsewhere. On Instagram/FB, my favorite is Rachel Cargle — she has a workshop you can follow about unpacking white feminism/white supremacy. It's about racism but equally about the importance of intersectional feminism (and how to be an intersectional feminist). But there are lots of other educators out there too that you can follow on Instagram, Facebook and elsewhere.
1631.) I would start with The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. 

&#x200B;

This is also an excellent resource:

[http://www.sfu.ca/\~wsweb/Programs/phdreading.html](http://www.sfu.ca/~wsweb/Programs/phdreading.html)

&#x200B;

It lists essential feminist texts as well as texts specific to different areas of study within feminism.
1632.) These aren't particularly introductory, but some of my favorites are:

Unbearable weight

In a different voice

Justice, gender, and the family

Marriage: A history
1633.) [removed]
1634.) Feminism, apparently is a problem (to feminists) but it's just some stupid people who push for equality but think that they're better than others... Also, theres a youtube channel called "ShoeOnHead" that talks a bit about feminism, i recommend the video 36 questions feminists have for men.
1635.)   Here are different kinds of feminism. 

\***Liberal** (disregard gender)  
\***Radical** (fight male supremacy)

Fighting male supremacy helps reduce racist oppression   
\***Marxcist** (who produces and who reaps rewards)

Sexist oppression is a form of class oppression; women who do more get less                                     rewards  
\***Socialist** (who is controlling resources)

Emphasize material and economic inequality

Talks about class and patriarchy   
\***Cultural** (retreat to vanguardism)

Work to build women’s culture, active on social issues  
\***Eco-feminism** (patriarchal society exploits resources)

Draws parallels between treatment of environment, animals, resources to treatment of women
1636.) MissRepresentation is an incredible documentary. It really makes you see how women are portrayed in the media. 
1637.) Chimamanda Adichie
1638.) Hey! I run a vlog about feminism aimed to educate :) right now I’m starting off with basic concepts in feminism but as I cover the fundamentals I’ll delve into deeper topics and my page is always open for discussion if you message me and please do feel free to! Here’s the link:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ByXKUxGp_-uBKkfCrg5tA

1639.) I strongly recommend reading Kimberlé Crenshaw's ""Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics" and "Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence Against Women." Crenshaw can give you both a background and critique of 2nd wave feminism. [https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=uclf](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=uclf)

&#x200B;

Crenshaw posits that the experience of women is not universal, nor is it monolithic; rather, experience is affected by race, gender, religion, culture, geography, etc. What Crenshaw did was create space in feminism for all women, not just white women. her work has been extremely important to the discipline and to identity politics.

Happy reading! 
1640.) The War on Women is a great read to tell you about female inequality from around the world - it's a good inspiration for feminism.

&#x200B;

I'd say Feminists: What Were They Thinking on Netflix is a good doc.

  
Also concur with previous suggestions for Angela Davis' Women Race and Class - great history and rise of feminism for black women.
1641.) I have found the United Nations website to have good resources on Gender Equality and also the UN Women website. There are some good resources related to modern feminism.

One of the key things I have learned as a feminist when looking at history, is to not assume that because someone is a feminist (and has a shared cause), they share the same views and ideals in other areas. Their personal and political views and agendas can often be completely different from what one would expect, to the point of sometimes being completely opposite. This shows up quite a bit when looking at feminism through the 20th century.
1642.) **Want to learn more about strong and influential women who have played a role in the feminist movement? Listen to this podcast!**

She's so cool is a female empowerment podcast about women whose stories will inspire you to embrace who you are, love yourself fiercely, and pursue your dreams.

1643.) I don’t have time to read all 500 comments so I’m not sure if this has been mentioned already. But I really liked Estelle Freedman’s book No Turning Back. 

It gave a good history of feminism, suffrage and talked about key current issues. 
1644.) My favourite books are the Feminine Mystique and Bad Feminist. For contemporary issues you can look at Bust or Ms Magazine. 
1645.) Kate Manne's Down Girl is great, it came out last year; it examines sexism as a mindset, misogyny as a patriarchal system of policing women, and a lot of points drawn from that.

My only complaint is that I hate how modern philosophers write, and that doesn't have a lot to do with her.
1646.) I’m taking a Literature and Gender class right now and till today, we’ve studied:
A Vindication of the Rights of Woman - Mary Wollstonecraft 
Subjection of Women - John Stuart Mill 
A Room of One’s Own - Virginia Woolf
The Second Sex - Simone de Beauvoir 
These texts are (imho) very euro-centric though. They even compare sexism directly to slavery. So I watch out for that but try to take in the relevant bits. 
1647.) Back in the 90s when I was in high school, I read Susan Faludi's Backlash and found it riveting.  It went into great detail on the way the media (commercials, news, tv shows, etc) infected society with anti-feminism.  I find it very relevant today as much of what she points out is still occurring all these years later.
1648.) I have a degree in Gender and cultural studies. Want a list some text books? 
1649.) I watched this TED Talk and thought you would find it interesting.

1650.) Have you tried looking at Feminist Instagrams? I learned A LOT - i know it can seem weird coming from a social media sight but my eyes were opened up to so much more thru some profiles on instagram, it’s run by people passionate abt the causes and they are open minded to good criticism when they make wrong conclusions etc etc. :))) hope this helps
1651.) What sucks about the situation is that people who have it ingrained in them to hate planned parenthood probably stopped reading this post after the first couple sentences.
1652.) This is why we need Planned Parenthood. I’m often shocked but not surprised when people think PP only does abortions, the hatred they have for PP is very well ingrained
1653.) Not to mention that PP is critical for a lot of trans people getting their HRT.
1654.) I’m shocked anyone would be against this. My country is overpopulated and already has bad health plans. I’m trying to understand why anyone would fight this? Are people against common sense ?
1655.) I remember getting a ride from my friend’s mom to PP when i was 16. My parents were/still are evangelical Christians, so i had to hide it from them. I had PCOS and had no other way to access birth control to help control it. The people at the clinic were so kind. As an adult now i donate to that same clinic.
1656.) Also it shouldn't be illegal to pay for abortions with tax money.
1657.) I don't get this whole hate against people who have different life choices. Does it affect me what some other people are doing? No. So why be upset? I just don't get it. And if it is about "My taxes are paying for something I don't like". Then people seem to not know what taxes are. 

PS: I'm not American and don't know much about the tax system there. But taxes in general aren't a service you pay for line an ISP or TV channels. They are community money to help the whole community in all kinds of ways that don't always need to be applicable to everyone.
1658.) Do you think god stays in heaven because he too, is afraid of what he created?
1659.) I still don't get how, if I ask the protestors to leave me alone (specifically me) and they are still there screaming how that is not harassment.

You can protest, I love protesting, but once you start screaming at individual people repeatedly, that's no longer protesting and is just abusive. Esp people obtaining medical care. I don't see how this doesn't violate my privacy. I don't get how the powers that be claim that nothing can be done. (I do not consider private citizens and political figures with power to be on the same level, so go ahead and protest them on an individual basis all you want)
1660.) Hey OP! IPhone tip: Your phone charges faster if you take it off low power mode when plugged in!
1661.) People are so against pp because they preform abortions. What they dont see is how pp probably prevents *so many* abortions. Its incredibly hypocritical.
1662.) What if they re-branded and changed their name to help encompass the fact that they have *so many* different services?

&#x200B;

They were exceptionally helpful for me to find birthing classes in my town when my own hospital had no options.
1663.) Many people on the pro life side completely support the right of a woman to have an abortion and actually consider themselves feminists.  Its the later term baby murders that they have a problem with.
1664.) [removed]
1665.) If we acknowledge that hijab is a choice for some (and that must be respected) we must also acknowledge the fact that for many women around the world the hijab is mandatory and there are consequences for not wearing it.  Look at Iran.  A lawyer who peacefully advocated for it to become non-mandatory has been sentenced to nearly 40 years in prison as well as over 100 lashes on her body.
1666.) I love this a lot, now I’m seeing a ton more, each more inclusive, we could add a woman in a wheel chair, a transgender woman, a girl, an elder.... options are endless. We can do it
1667.) solidarity, sisters ✊
1668.) I get what this is trying to say, but I feel like it's trying to 'correct' the old poster, as though it was wrong, which it wasn't, and I find those kinds of posts annoying.. it's not that they are trying to give a new take on something that bothers me, it's that the 'correction' is needless because the old version was not wrong or immoral, and the white woman is taken off entirely which in this context is off putting. I think it's the underlined part that seems like a correction. Also, the grammar is off.
1669.) We can “all” do it
1670.) Seriously how do you shit on a post that’s positive?  It’s baffling

Edit: you
1671.) It’s not white supremacist in its intentions, but the affects definitely celebrate white women over other women. Straight white women were pretty much the only target of this add. This poster started as a celebration/ encouragement for the white women entering the work force when their husbands went off to war. What about black women? They were already in the work force out of necessity before this because they didn’t have the privilege to be a  part of a single income household (generally). Where was their celebration/encouragement? Nothing wrong with privilege, as long as you don’t throw a fit when those less privileged than you just want equality.

I fail to see how this poster is doing anything mean to the first one. You can recognize flaws yet still acknowledge that it was a good and/or necessary starting point, and I think this poster does just that. Agree to disagree I guess. One thing that remains true is that Rosie the Riveter is a feminist icon and probably always will be. This poster doesn’t take away from that, nor is it radical in the slightest.
1672.) Beautiful painting
1673.) Could you please link the artist, OP?
1674.) [removed]
1675.) Good in theory, but this is a little ironic. The hijab is anti-feminist.
1676.) Where did the white lady go ?
1677.) [removed]
1678.) [removed]
1679.) [removed]
1680.) [removed]
1681.) [removed]
1682.) There is quite an excessive use of caps lock in both the post and the title.
1683.) [removed]
1684.) [removed]
1685.) There are few things that piss me off as much as the idea of a man being a player and a woman being a slut.
1686.) This is so important.  Amatonormativity should be a feminist issue because it pressures women into relationships that are unhelpful to them, makes women devote more time and emotional energy than is best for them to the pursuit or maintenance of romance, and keeps women staying in unhealthy relationships when they should leave.  

Amatonormativity can benefit some men, but it emotionally destroys just as many of them.  Men lose all their self esteem and believe they're worthless if they can't find a romatic relationship, or when a woman breaks-up or divorces them.  It is a toxic cultural attitude that hurts both women and men, and it needs to die.
1687.) I'm not sure there are legal protections in place, but at the very least, you might have a case for gender discrimination. I assume that "too much is visible" refers to somebody being able to see the shape of your nipples through your clothing. Unless your boss is also requiring that men pad their tees so that nobody can tell that anybody has nipples, this seems like an unequal expectation for men and women.   


Maybe approach it from the injury standpoint? Let the boss know that what they are asking will cause physical harm to you, provide a doctor's note (I'm sure a friendly primary care doc would be happy to support you), smile, and tell the boss that you're sure they wouldn't want to be responsible for placing requirements on their employees that cause physical harm.    


Some legal discussion:

[https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/dress-codes-must-women-wear-bra-at-work/](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/dress-codes-must-women-wear-bra-at-work/)
1688.) you might want to check r/legaladvice
1689.) There is likely not a law that specifically would prohibit them from asking you to wear (or not wear) a bra. There is possibly an argument that an attorney could make that it is discriminatory, but you would have to go down that route and it can be long and complicated. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, dress codes are allowed and they can be different for the sexes, but that does not mean that certain rules cannot be challenged.

If in fact you have a shoulder injury that makes wearing a bra difficult (or wearing a bra exacerbates that injury), I would discuss this with your doctor for evidence of the injury and how a bra can make it worse, then bring that information to HR. You can also try discussing with HR first why you find it difficult to wear a bra. Document the conversation (maybe send a follow up email reiterating what was discussed). Then take it from there. Be willing to find a compromise if one is possible.

I am not a GA barred attorney. If you feel that it is necessary, please seek local counsel. Most should give you a free consultation (30 minutes or so). It is never a good idea to trust legal advice on the internet.
1690.) As a fellow bra hater I recommend pasties.  The kind that stick without using actual adhesive.  They are great and cover just the nips which is what they are complaining about essentially.

Of course this is just my recommendation until you figure out the legality of it all.

Personally I hate having to wear bras and if it were up to me not wearing one would be socially acceptable in all circumstances.

I believe employers are legally permitted to have dress codes for their employees provided they are not descriminatory, but each state does vary so sorry I don't know how to answer your question.
1691.) Have you looked at any equalities legislation? If men aren't required to wear bras, its sexual discrimination to require women to wear bras.
1692.) Unless it’s spelled out specifically in your company dress code, they can’t make you wear one as that would be gender discrimination and isn’t a safety issue. Honestly, they’d have an awfully hard time enforcing it even if it were spelled out as any uniform inspection about requiring a bra would need an inappropriate level of exposure to enforce.

Kinda like my sister who cheated her way through high school by writing notes on her thighs just under the hem of her miniskirts. Even female teachers couldn’t ask her to lift her hem to check.
1693.) I have days when it really hurts to wear a bra. I wear snug, but breathable tank tops underneath my other clothes as an alternative to a bra on those days. That or depending on how sensitive your injured area is you could also wear a camisole with a shelf bra inside under your regular t-shirts. Bras are the worst. I’m sorry. Good luck!!
1694.) To my knowledge I don’t think so
1695.) I hear ya! I've torn a tiny ligament where the collarbone attaches at the chest. There is no bra that doesn't aggravate it. I often use a bra strap on the good shoulder and sports tape my right boob up by going across my chest to the left shoulder. I need a one-boob brace!
1696.) That's awful, I'm not sure about the legalities but fuuck that
1697.) I would talk to your boss, and see if yall can work something out. Explain you have a shoulder injury and why you don't want to wear a bra because it is painful for you. Perhaps you guys could come to an agreement like maybe you wear an apron when customers are around? I don't think there is a law on the books that you can reference about this because companies can institute dress codes and these dress codes can be different for men and women. However, r/legaladvice maybe more helpful.
1698.) Its not ilegall in canada and i think the in the us but its an asshole move from the complainer idk who would go to a manger and tell him your employee need a bra
You can leave  the work i suggest because stuff like this are really in the hands of the manger
1699.) Why would someone complain about this
1700.) Just you wait, if you start wearing a bra someone will complain that they can see it. 😩
1701.) Just get some pasties if that's the only issue?
1702.) I would lean on the side of that they can't force you too, unless it's written in some company dress code. I doubt a legal case which would be quick, easy, or cheap though. I don't know how hot it gets where you are, but maybe a vest underneath could help the situation? I suppose it depends on how perky your nipples are, but I don't want to get too personal.
1703.) [deleted]
1704.) You should not have to wear a bra to work if you don’t want to.
1705.) Georgia is an "at will/right to work state" which really means you can be fired for any reason (or even without reason), so be careful. There's a chance you could try to pursue this through discrimination laws, but it would likely be a challenge. Maybe you can figure out a compromise otherwise. Good luck. Definitely check with the legal advice subs, though.

*This is purely my layman's opinion*
1706.) That could be a case for gender discrimination if that rule doesn't apply to people who identify as male. Bra's are unnecessary and a result of the over-sexualization of breasts anyways.
1707.) It's called reasonable accommodation. You don't have to wear a 'bra' but you may have to do something to conceal you nipples. My sister works for the sate of Indiana and had a similar problem. A second shirt is good in the cooler months for her, but she uses nipple caps for summer.
1708.) Don't know the legallity of bra wearing in the workforce and don't know if this is unwanted advice but... Sports bras are excellent for women and physical activity! I felt bad you would have to wear a bra at the expense of comfort due to an old shoulder injury at work.
1709.) Meet in the middle. Just wear pasties. No bra. No nipples. Wouldn't the nipple be the most tell-tale sign of not wearing a bra? Idk?

Edit: a word
1710.) The short answer is yes in the United States.
1711.) Just wear a damn bra
1712.) [removed]
1713.) Sue them
1714.) It’s part of a uniform, they decide the uniform
1715.) [removed]
1716.) Awesome video! I'm definitely sharing this one.
1717.) Spartan women held higher power then any other women in Ancient Greece. They held more political power, more control over their reproduction, chose whom they married and even ate more then other Greek women?
1718.) Wow. I guess Sparta did some things right.
1719.) Wikipedia has her birthday as January 6th. Looking further into it, it's said that "Joan herself did not know when she was born, as it emerges from her testimony at her Trial of Condemnation."

Guess that means today's as good as any other one then.
1720.) Jeanne D'Arc would stand just out of crossbow range and yell at the English to surrender or they would all die. After a string of very unlikely victories, the English were terrified at this girl claiming visions of the divine. She was independent of any of the aristocratic families and so could sidestep the politics of the era to present common sense or even astute tactics that led to a series of extremely unlikely victories that put France close to expelling the English during the Hundred Years War.

She was a virgin but dressed as a man, with that being basically the only thing the English could pin on her during the religious tribunal once she was captured. She was literally executed under the pretense of cross dressing.. after being grilled by loaded questions about Catholic doctrine. Famously, when they asked her if she was in a state of grace, she replied:

>"If I am not, may God place me there; if I am, may God so keep me. I should be the saddest in all the world if I knew that I were not in the grace of God. But if I were in a state of sin, do you think the Voice would come to me? I would that every one could hear the Voice as I hear it. I think I was about thirteen when it came to me for the first time."

This being important because Catholics aren't supposed to say they're in a state of grace. But they needed to kill her under religious pretenses for propaganda purposes. She resisted to the end, even if repenting would have saved her life.

She never actually fought but she was always on the frontlines. She was injured 4 times, one time with an arrow through her neck/collarbone.
1721.) Executed for being a competent and effective leader, as is their tradition.

/s
1722.) I love the viragos of history
1723.) Nowadays, she is a far-right wing Icon in France though.
1724.) I took her name as my confirmation name. ❤️
1725.) [removed]
1726.) Nonbinary peeps be like "lol" and take the elevator.
1727.) Definitely not perfectly. There are so many factors that have an influence on equality, gender is just one of them. Well-educated woman from a Western country has far better chances than a poor man from developing country. And so many other situations and privileges between those two. While this is probably a good reminder to some, we can't keep forgetting that the woman in picture has probably had far better opportunities than the majority of world's population.
1728.) Yeah, but think of how strong her legs will be when she makes that climb every morning.
1729.) Um aktually woman CHOOSE to take the stairs hur dur me smart
1730.) [removed]
1731.) And neither stairs are accessible to wheelchair users. There might be an elevator I can't see (there probably is), they are still unintentionally making a point about intersectionality.
1732.) im waiting for the 'okay so the males have escalators but its more narrow for us, the women have stairs and they are wider hehe'
1733.) Does anyone else think we’re minimising a complex social issue into a stereotypical binary problem?  Of course there’s benefits to being male in terms of privilege, but when a woman faces ‘the stairs’ in this analogy, how much of an impact does her race, age, social status etc. have on their journey?

I say that as somebody who 100% consistently minimalists social issues like this to try and prove a point such as why the patriarchy is bad for all.
1734.) [removed]
1735.) There should also be a down escalator that you must climb up for people of color.
1736.) I'm just here to watch the incels cry.
1737.) [removed]
1738.) This post is extremely stupid. This does not highlight any actual problems with society. A woman is just as capable of reacher her goals as a man. Instead of upvoting this you should upvote posts that expose true sexism in the world.
1739.) Women have it better than men,
Change my mind
1740.) But walking up the stairs is faster >_>
You also get exercise and escalators are sometimes shut down due to technical issues. Stairs are almost perfect in every way except for connivence.
1741.) False it is more like feminists fighting for inequality
1742.) [removed]
1743.) This is just dumb but ok
1744.) I feel like the female staircase should be the narrower one, though.
1745.) lol just take the elevator
1746.) [removed]
1747.) If it's easier to live as a man, then why aren't we seeing millions of women trying to become men? Isn't gender just a social construct anyways?
1748.) TBH It’s more of an opposite at this point
1749.) It’s 2019, you can literally pass as a man with a few prescriptions, but wait y’all won’t do that because you know what’s happening to men and you don’t want any part of it.
1750.) Lol
1751.) That’s definitely not the case in the US
1752.) Take the fucking escalator then if you don't wanna walk up the stairs you dumb shit. Easy as that.
1753.) Perfectly Balanced.... as all things should be
1754.) Honestly in a few years the genders in this picture will be swapped, and only a woman will be in the picture, the man would be serving ‘rape’ charges
1755.) Majority of homeless and incarcerated persons are men. Men are more likely to die on the job. But go on.
1756.) Imagine unironically believing this
1757.) Your right, this is accurate. She struggles when she could have just done it the way the man did it, and work for it. There were no escalators for me on my way up. The fuck outta here with this shit.
1758.) I don't get it
1759.) This post is kinda a weak attempt
1760.) This Is Why You Change Your Gender To Male, I'm Getting My Sister To Do That
1761.) As a woman, I really dislike blanket generalizations like this, as it makes men resent feminism as a whole. Instead of picking issues they may agree with, we say blanketly subjective things like this which make us all roll our eyes.
1762.) This is progress because women are the fatter gender.
1763.) But... Stairs are faster...
1764.) I work in stem and I haven't had a Male boss in 9 years.
1765.) I get that it’s a bit of fun (I hope it’s not meant to be a serious take on equality), but this is really problematic , not least because of the analogy.  Nope nope nope.
1766.) [removed]
1767.) [removed]
1768.) Not here to argue but can someone explain how females have to work harder to achieve the same things as a male?

Edit: so rather than actually helping me understand something I don’t, you just down vote me... kinda ironic
1769.) Wait, so I just get to the top by not working at all? Only women work?

Didn't think this through did they.
1770.) This is America, everyone works or their homeless.

1774.) Nope, it heavily depends on class/race/ability as well. This is far too simplistic and frankly extremely obnoxious.
1775.) is this the antithesis of the concept of intersectionality?

1777.) [removed]
1778.) [removed]
1779.) [removed]
1780.) Well....not really. It's so far from black and white like that. Plenty of women have it easier than men too, it just depends on a lot of different factors.

Should it be just as easy/difficult for both? Yes. Do women on average have more issues like this than men? Yes. But does that mean all men have it this easy, and all women have it this hard? No, not by a longshot.

A more accurate depiction would be a couple hundred sets of stairs for men and women, a lot of them escalators for men, and a lot escalators for women, with most certainly a bit of a higher percentage of escalators for men, but not nearly as much as an oversimplification like this would otherwise convey.

1782.) [removed]
1783.) I don't think we can compare a social issue as complex as this to stairs.

Just a though.

1785.) What the actual fuck did I just read? I’m on the verge of angry tears just now. What is wrong with the fucking world? Nay, not the world, the fucking American conservative far right. Human decency? Heard of it? Bastards.
1786.) Doesn't surprise me. Trump wants to protect rapist american troops from persecution. Many US troops have committed atrocities against the civilian populations around the world.
1787.) It’s shocking but not surprising considering how much of the world, but especially the US has been behaving recently 😔
1788.) America, what the hell is happening over there?
1789.) This is dumb.

What does the resolution imply exactly tho ?

I read the article but i'm not sure to understand.
1790.) Yeah, it really isn't about a difference in opinion. One side is quite clearly in the wrong.
1791.) This man is disgusting and immoral.
1792.) Just for the sake of complete accuracy, he didn’t say the words “rape is the will of God.” He was asked the direct question “is rape the will of God” and gave an affirmative non-answer. His response:

>	Well, you know, if you read the Bible, there’s actually a couple circumstances where that happened. The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean you can go down that path, but it’s the reality unfortunately.

So yeah, not exactly false, but saying he “declares” and then putting “rape is the will of God” in quotes isn’t totally accurate. Ultimately his answer wasn’t any better, though.
1793.) So because someone decides to rape, it's the will of God. But if you decide to get an abortion, that's somehow not the will of God? It's almost like these lines in the sand are drawn arbitrarily based on some old order of power.
1794.) Ya know what else is the will of God? Arresting the sob that did it. Cherry picking at it's best?
1795.) Will of god? If god is whispering this in your ears seek help.
1796.) Somehow I don't trust this article, can we not post obvious bait?
1797.) That guy looks like the personification of egg salad.
1798.) I just wanna say on behalf of the Catholics that we don’t believe that
1799.) I live in Oklahoma but I think I’ll start packing now
1800.) As someone from Oklahoma, I'm sorry so many people here are like this. 

It's embarrassing and enraging.
1801.) Holy god I cannot believe that a person said that! WTF!?
1802.) OK, Commander...
1803.) The will of god? Pretty sure if there was a god it would be at least moderately anti rape. The nerve of these assholes. I wonder if he'd change his tune if he was the one getting raped.
1804.) WHAT. THE. FUCK
1805.) I am so glad this twat lost his election directly following making these remarks.
1806.) Actually the will of God is to hit bankers with a whip
1807.) The next time someone asks me why we need feminism, I’m pulling this out
1808.) I feel like that'd be more from Islam
1809.) I’m a Republican who lurks here every once in a while to see how my opposition thinks. Put myself in their/your shoes in a bit. But srsly, who the fuck says that rape is God’s will lmao
1810.) I’m a republican and this is one of the biggest lies I have ever heard
1811.) Funny, because Republicans also like to condemn immigrants for being “rapists.”
1812.) To be fair both parties say dumb things
1813.) Have no democrats raped people or said such things?
1814.) [removed]
1815.) I agree that this is morally wrong, but when feminists rape someone, aren't they protected by other feminists?
1816.) [removed]
1817.) That made me laugh
1818.) The belief in the importance of marriage and romantic coupling is one factor.  There are others.  Unequal work opportunities for women and unequal childbearing burdens too.  All structural.
1819.) I know I'm not supposed to expand on the OP in the comments, but just wanted to highlight two things that I'm looking for an explanation for.

1. In Amie Jones' book, she suggests battered women deflect the attention of violent men from the rest of society. As in, if a violent man didn't have someone at home to victimize he'd end up going after someone else, perhaps a woman who has more people around her who would object to her victimization. Her words, not mine. I wonder if this holds up or not. InCel comes to mind (the "Involuntary Celibate terrorist who hit random women with a car because he couldn't get any dates). Is Jones suggesting there would be way more InCels if all the women with abusive partners could get out right away? That on some level society tolerates the abuse of some women because they believe it keeps other women safe?
2. The techniques batterers use to victimize are surprisingly consistent and sophisticated. The same techniques are used in government reeducation camps or with prisoners of war. They know how to make a person question their sanity, cut them off from their friends, escalate dependency in a very predictable way until the battered person actually loves the attacker. (see the case of Hedda Nussbaum). Where did so many abusers learn how to do this? Is this the remains of a more system wide kind of oppression that was practiced more consciously/"officially" in the past? To go back to the racism analogy, under Jim Crow there were all these widespread practices that added up to create an oppressive environment. There would have been a "curriculum" of sorts among whites to train them to keep that system going. And there was backlash if a white person didn't do their part to hold it up. So.... is there a parallel to that with domestic violence?
1820.) I'm by no means an expert on this matter, but as a social work student, I learned a feminist perspective on domestic violence and it was very enlightening. Basically in a patriarchal society, women are subordinate to men and violence is used to continue to enforce this discrepancy.   
Obviously like all theories it is not perfect, but it's definitely worth a quick read to see if it answers some of your questions.
1821.) I think that there isn’t a portion of society held up by domestic violence. Other than emergency services, in which you could then, by that logic, say that all crimes uphold this section of the workforce. However, I can give this: my theory is that since most of the time males are physically bigger, more imposing, and more into some stereotypical manly things that could support physical abuse (i.e bodybuilding, drinking, etc.) This is why I think that the counterpart to the male physical abuser is the female mental abuser. Keep in mind, I’m not an expert, but I think men have the unfair expectation from society that they can’t cry, and frankly, society sees a man getting abused by a female as embarrassing on the males part. This either creates one of two things: the mental fortitude to push through, or something worse, which could be them staying in that relationship without reaching out for help or teaching their SO that this is not OK. Of course there are exceptions to every rule (i.e smaller males, bigger females, mental/physical conditions, etc.) Probably not in line in this sub, but have my take :).
1822.)  ***Update***: Noah Spielman, Kyler Kregel and Samuel TeBos all pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery and were sentenced to one year of conditional discharge requiring them to each pay a $250 anti-crime fee and complete 100 hours of public service — including 25 hours of speaking to youths about the dangers of hazing, the [**Daily Herald**](https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180716/former-wheaton-college-football-player-pleads-guilty-in-hazing) reports. James Cooksey pleaded guilty this July to a misdemeanor count of attempted unlawful restraint and was sentenced to one month of court supervision. Benjamin Pettway, is expected to stand trial early next year. 

This sentencing seems extremely light.  I'm amazed anyone does hazing at any level in this day and age, but the fact there is no jail time is sickening.
1823.) I'll be anticipating protests from the MRA's concerning this miscarriage of justice. 

Oh wait....
1824.) I’m so fucking sick of jocks (I.e. any man) getting away with rape and assault. We live in a sick society run by sick, twisted men. The patriarchy must end.
1825.) All rapists and people who do this type of humiliating sexual torture should be destroyed. We do not need people like this in our society. They are useless.
1826.) jesus christ
1827.) I don’t want to live on this planet anymore
1828.) I'm originally from that town and I know the college well. I'm not surprised these boys are going unpunished. The whole point of attending Wheaton College is to go from the hateful cradle of evangelism in which your parents raised you straight to an insular environment where you remain totally brainwashed. When you're admitted they make you sign a contract that until recently forbade "social dancing" a la Footloose. It's a totally regressive environment promoting only the most hateful dogma. Intellectual curiosity is discouraged.

The ideal mental age for the students there is forever 15, especially the girls. Unplanned pregnancies are common among the students. I'm pretty sure they expel them for it. 

So, basically, that place is disgusting in every way.
1829.) They kidnapped and raped/tortured someone, and that's all they fucking get?
1830.) Just another story about white boys getting away with violating another humans rights. I have to ask what can we do to stop this from happening? It seems like the laws we have punish rapists aren't enough
1831.) A bunch of football players beat and pushed a kid down the stairs and only one kid was suspended for it 

The rest had no punishment at all
1832.) I genuinely can't fathom this
1833.) me reading this title: “oh man they’re actually getting punished for this horrible thing they did. Oh.”
1834.) This is fucking disgusting.
1835.) I remember seeing this story on some local news website after it happened (or after it made it's way outside the school walls anyhow).  The article detailed literally everything included in this one, but never once described it as rape.  I left a comment pointing that out and my comment was scrubbed within a half hour.  I fucking hate this country.
1836.) > Christian college

This is gonna be bad.

> punished football players who raped and beat a student

Oh thank god they didn't just get away with it.

> with an 8-page essay

*They deserve that many years in jail.*
1837.) That’ll teach em
1838.) I just finished 'Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town' by John Krakauer which I recommend. It's a good, but absolutely infuriating, book about college rape and ensuing injustice.
1839.)  This survivor will have to live with the trauma from kidnapping, assault, and sexual assault. A slap on the wrist was not even what the perpetrators got. It was a pinch. But that's all good!
1840.) It’s sad our society have a lot of scummy people like this even today, seeing things like this happen really is destroying my faith in humanity every day😔
1841.) I don't want to believe this is real. What's wrong with society?
1842.) Look at the guy in the middle’s smile tho
1843.) Thought the headline meant that they literally beat the student with a 8 page essay, so I thought "good, they got punished" and a few seconds later, I realised the punishment was actually the 8 page essay. Assholes, why did they get let off so easily?
1844.) Are they going to beat him with it? Make him get papercuts on every corner? Force him to spell it backwards? Because otherwise it's not a punishment.😤
1845.) I wish I could say I was surprised. I reported a hazing incident done by the varsity football team to my high school's social worker and it was completely swept under the rug. I'm not surprised at all. I want to throw up right now
1846.) Local sports stars get off easy,  not surprisingly.
1847.) Why is this on the feminist page
1848.) [removed]
1849.) I've seen girls fight harder on a first date.
1850.) Sorry white women, this is the price of maintaining white supremacy,  white males get impunity against you too. 

Yea, I know it feels good being able to call the cops on black people at dog parks whenever you want, but it's a double edged sword, you see?

You can't eat your cake and have it.

1853.) \^"Andrea Dworkin insisted her writing was about women, but it was about men: what they do, why they do it, and which lies they use in their defense. Women couldn’t be subjects, only faceless victims."

1856.) Well my third world islamic country have legal aportion lol u people are weird
1857.) Abortion is immoral, change my mind.
1858.) The writer is a moron. period.
1859.) This relationship isn't healthy, you both resent each other and neither of you are going to change. Split up, get a few counselling sessions/ therapy sessions to help you cope with it all and move on. There are better men in the world who you don't have to fight with about respecting you.
1860.) Honestly if I were in your position, I’d just dump him. My ex was very similar to your boyfriend and the relationship just wasn’t beneficial to either of us anymore.
1861.) Even the best men frequently don't realise how sexist some of their words and behaviour can be. They've been surrounded by an echochamber of sexism for most of their lives. The good ones will listen when you point it out, and then work on it. Don't bother with the ones who don't.
1862.) I think you know that you’re not wrong.
1863.) Good for you for telling him how you feel. It's scary but even when it doesn't go how you wanted it to, it's still rewarding to know  you can do it. I'm glad it went well this time.
1864.) Take a look at this comic. It discusses emotional labour and I think highlights a few of the things you are talking about here.

https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/
1865.) Girl, why are you with this dead weight? You’re his mom and his gf? And he manipulates you making you feel guilty for being you? F that noise
1866.) Sounds like a dude I couldn't spend prolonged time in one room with, how does he feel all that is okay to say and do?
1867.) As others have said, it is likely your relationship should come to an end. There is a very narrow path where your boyfriend actually goes through with some Feminist Therapy, which will take immense dedication on his part, and actually implements the changes that are important to you. Then, the relationship might be preserved.

Either way, I would recommend some counseling for yourself. Either way, it sounds like you would also benefit from some individual counseling. You acknowledge you have difficulty communicating your needs and expectations, and whatever relationship you end up in, this is a crucial skill.
1868.) Currently on the road, so I might add some more specific stuff later, but the underlying problem here appears to be that he does not actively invest in your relationship and shows a willingness and commitment to take on a fair share of labour when not belittled or told to. The only parts he appear prepared to invest in are the parts he find pleasing, or gratifying on an instant- and personal level rather than recognizing that a relationship require a lot of maintenance, logistics and labour that is not "fun". 

All your examples are ways he could show effort and investment that he does not. Every specific thing does not have to split 50/50, but as a whole it should be split fairly and as a whole both sides need to show investment, engagement and effort towards the other. Currently you do way more and get way less back. That is something that can break a person longterm

His sexism is very classic in terms of unfair division of unrecognised/unpaid labour (key is to include mental labour and initiative in this as well). But the core of it is unreasonable expectations that a relationship should be all play and no work from his end of the stick. Failure to see his flaws and attempt improvement by blaming outside factors (or you) rather than seeing his part is a typical defence mechanism that is hard, but necessary to work past on his side. Besides constructive/open-minded conversations and possibly therapy I'm not sure there is much you can do about that problem of his. It might be impossible for him to get there given the context or maybe it's possible. Either way, don't sell yourself short.
1869.) As a man, many of these "seeming not sexist" acts have underlying sexism ingrained.

Exception is #7, unless you also go shopping eith him for suits & DO NOT ENJOY IT.

But yeah, this is a problem we have with societal sexism. The finding boobs attractive vs what you find attractive is a HUGE one.
1870.) A lot of this strikes me as both of you being young and learning how to have a relationship but a lot of it is learned sexist behavior on his part. Just because he can unlearn it doesn’t mean you have to put up with it. It’s not your job to fix him. What’s key is that you apparently don’t trust him, and more often than not don’t like the way he makes you feel. That alone is grounds to end any relationship.
1871.) Like others have said, you're not wrong, and I'm seeing some massive red flags here for manipulative behavior. He was mean to you to see what he could get away with, and yes if you forgive him and take him back, even with conditions, he's getting away with it.

If you two get married it'll get even worse. Please get out now and find someone who is willing to respect you at a fundamental level. It may take a while but you need to be willing for as long as it takes (which is the hard part as we all get lonely).

Good luck, OP.
1872.) You’re not wrong. He’s being rude and dismissive of you. I’d say leave him and work on expressing yourself, discovering yourself so when you do find someone you might want to start a relationship with, you can communicate well with each other.
1873.) Sounds like you're dating a child. I think we both know you need to throw the whole man away.
1874.) You're not wrong, and honestly no dude is worth the mental gymnastics you are putting yourself through here. He sucks. You're young and you barely see each other anyway. Dump him and enjoy your life.
1875.) If ya'll want to stay together, go to couples therapy. It isn't just for married couples entrenched with kids. It's for any couple that needs to work on things. See a therapist together AND apart. 

Second, the words that keep jumping out at me are "lazy". He's lazy, lazy, lazy. He says so himself. My guess is, he's not lazy, it's just easier for him to let *you* do all the work. He might be sorry, and mean it, but until he actually changes...they're just words.
1876.) Your boyfriend using things you confided in him about to hurt you is definitely a deal breaker and you should break up. Don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy. 

I also don't think that you should be doing all the cooking and cleaning if you don't want to.  But that's something you need to communicate effectively and come to an agreement on with any partner. 

I can relate to you. My dad was the "I'll give you something to cry about" type and was physically abusive to me sometimes, especially if I showed any emotions he didn't like. I was bullied a lot in highschool, and that's when I learned to shut up and just deal with everything with silence. I became very nonconfrontational and didn't speak up for myself. I have made it my goal to get over that and have been making progress. I have noticed for me there is a point where I'm actually deciding to keep quiet and just deal with it, and I have been getting better at recognizing that and going against it when I should stand up for myself. It's scary but it has gotten easier with time. Hopefully that works for you. 

Don't be afraid to walk away from an issue and take some time to think about what you want to say. Also writing out what you want to say in a letter form works too in relationships. Good communication is one of the hardest parts of a relationship to figure out and it changes from person to person. 

That being said I don't think any communication fixes will change this relationship, he betrayed your trust by using what you told him against you.
1877.) get the hell outta there asap
1878.) Going against the grain here but I don't think he's fundamentally sexist. He sounds complacent and lazy and definitely shows sexist behaviours but just needs to grow up. Reddit commenters are quick to say "dump him" but that is extreme.

All of these issues can be worked through with good communication.
1879.) Sexist or not, you shouldn’t put up with this. As I’m seeing it he has issues that he might notice but doesn’t seem to do anything about it. I used to be with someone who would let me do all the work in the relationship because he was lazy he said, and even though I liked him a lot and I have known him for a long time, I had to let him go because I just wasn’t happy in this relationship. If you’re always the one complaining, it’s not because you make a big deal out of things you shouldn’t, it’s because you care about these issues and he doesn’t. It might have to do with sexism, it probably has to do with other things, but you don’t have to continue doing all the work. When you’re a mom to him it’s a sign he’ll stay in that relationship because it’s easy, and even if he does like you, you’ll exhaust yourself. I don’t know anything more than what you’ve written, but from the little I know, I’ll suggest you get out of this before it gets worst and really hurts you even more
1880.) But how is he ACTUALLY sexist? I mean he doesn’t think he is better than you so if he genuinely tries he could stop with his behaviour that you feel uncomfortable with.
1881.) A lot of people telling you that he is abusive but I really can't see that but also you are the only one  here that can really judge this. From what I read he accepted blame and didn't belittle you or straight up told you you were wrong for feeling this way, you didn't agree on the term (sexist or not) but you agreed that his behavior was wrong and in this specific case I don't see how discussing semantics could possibly be of any significant importance to the problem solving.
Also keep in mind that (sexist) behavior is often learned and not chosen we all show sexist behavior even if we think we are not. 

I have a hard time judging if his apologies are sincere and if he shows signs of caring and betterment.
He said some dumb shit but hell I said a bunch of dumb and insensitive shit that I am truly sorry for myself and so did my bf sometimes out of anger sometimes bc we didn't think sometimes we took joking too far but this certainly isn't how we treat each other on a regular basis our relationship is still defined by our kindness to each other. It wasn't always like this though. 

Most of your problems can be talked out that doesn't mean that you have to win every argument sometimes you will disagree like with the groceries but you can certainly demand that he at least keeps his opinion to himself since it upsets you and there is nothing to gain for him. If you don't want to cook all the time you don't have to he can either learn to cook by helping you for an example or he can order food for those days but if you ONLY care bc you think it is sexist than I don't think it makes sense to change the current arrangement. It certainly is important to share the workload but this doesn't mean everyone has to do exactly 50% of each chore. You are also mentioning things that happened back in high school, is this still really relevant to his behavior now?
1882.) Try posting this to r/amitheasshole for a objective answer.
1883.) The first step was putting this all out there. At least now he knows and will try to make it better if he cares. I'd be careful calling some of this stuff sexist though. Some men with the best feminist intentions are just too lazy to actually live the values. Like doing their fair share of chores. I had a similar heart to heart with my husband over chores and equality a couple years back. He surprisingly agreed with me that I did do most of the house work and now he helps a lot more. It's still not what I would consider a completely equal balance but it is much closer than it used to be and he's kept up with it for a couple years now.

As for when he was asking about your plans after college, I really think he was trying to gauge what kind of a future you wanted with him. It probably hurt him that you only talked about your career plans and didn't mention how he fit into your future after college. Plus, he could be thinking about kids and marriage and wanted to see if you were thinking about any of that.
1884.) > He does have bad memory, but the thing is I am not really a talker, so I expect him to remember stuff.

That sentence isn't a good starting point for a good argue. My parents do this all the time. Don't go hard on unspoken expectations in a team. A chain is only as resistant as the weakest unit.

It seems that you (plural) have a large experience difference. Talk more and explain to each other why you hate certain situations. Make your mind strong and help your friend.

Take my advice with a grain of salt. I am not a native as you probably noticed, so your local arguing culture might be different from my experience and that could've lead to false assumptions by me.
1885.) He seems to me he has a pretty set idea about gender roles. He’s not outright sexist, but he’s grown up in an environment that bred these ideas about what women do and what men do. He really isn’t doing anything consciously but also isn’t aware of how his behavior is problematic. If you decide to stick with him, make him aware of his behavior and how it is toxic and try help him unlearn his pre-conceived notions.
1886.) I really disagree with people who come out with "just break up with them". Obviously if they have a huge red flag, you have to get out of there but as others have pointed out, men are hugely unaware of women's issues and often it is a non-malicious but unfortunate oversight. It can also be upsetting to wake up to the fact that you're probably inherently sexist all your life and hard to come to terms with that so I would allow a little bit of time to come around and then see will they start trying to see your side/having more sympathy with women's issues.  The impression I've gotten from your post is that communication is a big issue and so if you feel like you are being as transparent as possible and giving him every chance and he still doesn't get it, maybe then it's time to nope the fuck out of there. It is unfortunate that he's trying to deny the sexist elements to his thinking though. Trust your gut, you're the only person here who knows what's going on between the two of you. But I can definitely say you're not wrong in your thinking. Hope things work out for you regardless.
1887.) Honestly most of it just sound like bad personality traits.
I feel like he doesn't respect you and is just super lazy and not willing to learn.

I understand that he doesn't like doing something he is uncomfortable (cooking) but he refusing to learn is just not acceptable. If you going to keep this up you end up cooking for him until the day he dies. Try to give him small task like cutting onions/meat and then slowly show him how to season things.
Just laying around and watching you clean makes me angry af. 
Make a cleaning agreement (he bathroom, you kitchen or whatever) and just kick his butt until he does.


He not listening when you tell him something is just.. bad.
This is a super long list of reasons to break up, especially since you have a lot of bad "reactions" from him already. Is it really worth it staying together if he already doesn't want to improve? Some of the stuff is feminist relevant, some just show me that he is a bad person/had noone growing up showing him how to get shit together. Really rethink if this relationship is worth fighting for.
1888.) You're too young to waste your time on this guy. Maybe you two would be better off as just friends. You can't change people, he's going to have to learn this lesson on his own. People will change on their own. Maybe later on he'll tell you that you're right. It sounds like you both are unhappy in this relationship. I would leave if I were you.
1889.) As a woman that has been in a similar situation most of this sounds like normal relationship stuff. One thing I will say is don't clean for him. He was raised differently than you and expecting him to just pick stuff up and clean is going to cause resentment. You need to be patient and lower your expectations of his behavior. No one is perfect and you are both learning your roles in the relationship. Men, not all but many, tend to not be as in tune with emotion as logical thinking. They don't think that by not cleaning and you cleaning is disrespectful or rude, it's not their fault they just don't see it that way. The fact that he is admitting to being lazy is at least him acknowledging that he is not pulling his weight. He knows this, but is lazy because you enable him by doing it for him. Communicate with him and tell him you would like him to clean his space if he wants you to.come over. If he doesn't know how to cook, you can teach him. He may not feel as confident about doing it and needs some guidance, not being babied. So be patient. The fact that he cleans and gets the groceries is him doing what he can so appreciate that instead of being ungrateful as not all men do this. If you want him to maintain his cleanliness tell him to do so for you to enjoy sex more. Men are driven more by sex because that will provide them with offspring where as women are more focused on a compassionate man who will be a good father figure on-top of health. There is nothing wrong with this, we evolved to be this way. If there is something in the future that is bothering you, write it down and find a way to communicate about it without being accusatory. There is more I could say but I'll do my best to summarize. You are both learning how to be each other's partner and a normal healthy part of relationships developing is to butt heads a little. You need to be able to pick your battles because not every little thing is a point for contention or accusation. You might very well be somewhat passive aggressive, so be aware of how you are reacting to his behavior. It takes two to argue so if he is acting defensively or your are coming at it emotionally, then you are going to fight. Defensiveness never works, but pushing someone all the time with your expectations will make him feel as though he can never do right by you. I would advice against just breaking up with him as others have mentioned because regardless of who you date, you will have identical problems and leaving them isn't always the answer. He isn't behaving great, but he isn't being horrible either. Your behavior isn't great, but it isn't horrible. You both are playing a part of disagreeableness. So taking a step back, writing down what you are thinking and feeling and taking the time to come together without being emotional will help solve some of these problems. Instead of coming at it from a mentality of I don't like this you need to stop, come at it from, I am experiencing negative affects from this behavior, how can we come together and compromise about these issues. The point is you both want to be heard and understood. You both don't want to be criticized or talked down to and want to be treated with respect. Take the time to be patient and think long before approaching a subject. I see a lot of promise and you both are still very young and are still developing. You both are still learning your roles in society and how you want to behave so the expectations need to meet that. If he is willing to discuss this and work on it, he is a good partner, even if it takes time, as all things do. He could be an individual who denies your feelings, doesn't apologize, doesn't help with the dishes or groceries, doesn't do anything in regards to his appearance, but it sounds like he wants to make you happy and he doesn't want to let you down. Be patient, lower your expectations, and don't do things for him and get mad because he didn't do it. If you're cleaning, ask him to help or ask him to clean up his stuff. Be patient with yourself to and take the time to calm down before approaching a situation. The reason why I keep repeating these things is because they take a while to learn. Long distance relationship are hard, I had one with my husband before we married where we wouldn't see each other for 5 months or more but we would talk every day. It will get easier, but the headbutting isn't over. Wish you both a good day
1890.) I feel like at some points you are overreacting, which is probably due to your past trauma, but he is also at fault at some points. I think you should either really start communicating with each other and resolving your problems or just leave it, because it's not worth it to have a relationship, if you're constantly arguing. Maybe you're not the perfect match and should work on resolving your issues separately, BUT you're the one that has to decide if the good in the relationship outweighs the bad or vice versa.
1891.) it sounds like you barely see each other and when you do you are arguing the entire time. taking a relationship from high school into college is tough. definitely break up with him and move on, experience some more things! you are young and he is not the only guy out there.
1892.) I have had very similar conversations with my boyfriend. We’ve been together for almost 7 years now and still every once in a while I find that his behavioural patterns, or the things that he says, indicate that deep down he has a hierarchy in his mind about feminine and masculine things, and so about women and men. 

The difference between being a rapist and doing sexist things is that sexism is taught at all levels of education and media creation and is sort of a brainwashing of a person. I myself still show some sexist underlying assumptions (mostly about men) and I work on recognizing them, deconstructing where I got that impression from and then changing my perspective on the person. 

I point it out to my boyfriend when I recognize something like that in him, and he also gets really defensive. It’s a normal reaction — sexism is a BAD THING and you’re telling the person who loves you that they’re doing a BAD THING — it’s natural for them to feel like you’re calling them a BAD PERSON. It’s a delicate conversation. It has a lot of forward progress and backward sliding, continuously. You’re trying to separate the person from the society, and that’s very difficult because in a lot of ways we are our society. 

The best thing for me has been a lot of gentleness, compassion and patience. Accept the backsliding but don’t stop calling it out. Accept the defensiveness but don’t back down. Don’t attack him personally but don’t sugar coat that he’s the one who is doing these things. 

Honestly it’s difficult to convey this in a little comment. But this work that you’re doing with your boyfriend, it’s a microcosm of the work we’re trying to do in wider society. We’re trying to get people to confront their underlying ideologies and recognize where they are lacking so that they may be improved. It’s a very draining, painful, and stressful exercise. The best way to succeed is to have someone we trust and respect guide us along the way. 

So at the end of the day... does your boyfriend respect you? Does he look up to you in any way? Because if he doesn’t, then you will not have much success, unfortunately. Not to mention that it won’t make for a very good long term relationship :/

Good luck friend. Make sure he’s the one you want to be spending all this energy on. It’s a never ending commitment.
1893.) Points 4 and 5 are sexist behaviour but I'm not sure about the rest.

You and your boyfriend sound like you may have run your course. One the one hand you may be expecting too much of him but, at the same time he's got to be prepared to compromise too.

Cooking, cleaning, grooming would be a good start. Make up shopping and painting your nails definitely seem to me a bridge too far.

I can understand how he was offened by being called sexist. Only the very worst people are proud of their sexist / racist /homophobic behaviours. Being called out on these behaviours can be hurtful, though necessary.
1894.) Repeatedly wronging you after apologizing is the classic cycle of abuse. 


Telling you that you shouldn’t feel a certain way after you’ve worked up the courage to share something that’s bothering you is gaslighting. 


He’s sexist and also unwilling to consider any viewpoint other than his own on the issue and obviously ready to lash out at you for just speaking your mind. 


None of this is healthy. I would end things with this guy and find someone who respects you as a person.  I know how much this sucks. Good luck and good on you for trying to communicate these problems with this doofus.
1895.) You've got enough to deal with, you can't possibly take care of this man-child AND pursue your goals. I've been in relationships like this, and the guys always play the victim. You need to handle yourself. Break up with him, focus on fixing yourself and healing from the past. You're too young to waste your previous time on him.
1896.) Oh boy, boy Boy. I \[F, 27\] was in a relationship like this when I was your age. All of this is bringing me back. Started dating when we were 17, stayed together until I broke up with him just before my 21st Birthday and I am *so glad* that I did. You'll be a happier person, a nicer person, a more positive person, have better self worth, etc. if you end this.   


Find someone who will treat you as an equal and is worth your time. Anything else is a major waste of life.
1897.) You are 21 and going through all this misery, so many good comments so far. Just want to throw in another, get out, get out now. This is a live and learn moment. This is a time to go and figure out who you are moment. Stop trying to fix this broken relationship and go enjoy your life.
1898.) I don’t think you’re in a very good relationship, you could either break up or try to resolve things. But judging how much of an ass your boyfriend is, he’d probably won’t take it well. 

Also, you probably shouldn’t take your boyfriend shopping, he probably hates it. If you get a new partner, don’t take them shopping unless they want to. They would probably hate it too, at least from my experience.
1899.) he sounds like a dick stop ackin like a clown and leave him lol
1900.) looks like youre just uncompatible
1901.) I really think this is the wrong sub to post. r/amitheasshole is good for this. With a title like this and on this sub, I’m just assuming you are trying to assure yourself you are right without reaching a more diverse demographic.
1902.) Wow- I am saying this with the best possible intent- I don't think you should be in a relationship with anyone right now. I think you have a lot of issues in your own personal life and in your approach to sexism and equal rights. Your boyfriend gets a lot of shit wrong but you seem to be in a place where you are just gathering and storing each little thing and mashing it all together to create one huge issue. There are a few things that highlight this-

**You got upset because he forgot you had seen a movie.** I (a woman) do that all the time.

**You are upset because you cook and he does the dishes**. That seems like a perfect deal if he doesn't know how to cook. If he was being sexist he would revert to the age old twat joke about women and kitchen sinks.

I think you need to figure some shit out on your own because it seems like you, yourself are projecting some of your childhood trauma onto him. 

Good luck.
1903.) I don't think there's anything wrong with a partner not wanting to paint your nails, or wanting to go bra/makeup shopping (as I get older, I get more vocal about not doing things I don't want to do just for the sake of appeasing my partner, and I wouldn't want to force them to do things they don't enjoy for the sake of appeasing me either, I have friends for that), or thinking that certain ingredients are better than others. There's also nothing sexist about it. I would definitely be concerned about him pouting when you don't want sex, though, and he should help you clean. But if you cook and he shops/cleans up......that's also not sexist.
1904.) Sexist or not, why would you want to date this person? I’m sure there are plenty of people who share his positive qualities that also are not assholes. Honestly girl, you’d probably be better off on your own.

1906.) Your writing ability clearly shows your way too smart for this dude. Dump the guy and move on. Your super young and have an amazing life ahead of you you don’t have to drag his sorry ass around, too.
1907.) Are you serious 21? 7. And 8. Are so ridiculous it makes me not believe anything you say.
1908.) [deleted]
1909.) I'm gonna be honest, you shouldn't stay in that relationship.
There's a whole lot of reasons why but don't misunderstand, I'm not saying it's all his fault in fact I think you're the reason why your relationship is deteriorating.
He's being a regular guy and you're assuming things about his actions that you aren't even confirming, somehow you make yourself believe that he has this scheme to knock you down to make you less of a human being because you're a woman, when in reality he'll just get annoyed like a guy and respond like a guy and you'll slide in an undertone of sexist thoughts he might've had during the time and then it stacks up down the road which you started stringing together. 
To be blunt you keep jumping to conclusions which you aren't confirming, which is causing a back lash on him because he genuinely doesn't try to be sexist, and you assuming he's being sexist is like tying the noose to your relationship, stop thinking negatively and just move on.

P.S. You don't have to take this seriously, this was from the perspective of an inexperienced guy that had to deal with people calling him sexist/toxic/racist on a weekly basis, so by all means ignore this if you think it's only going to screw things up

1915.) The "good on you" app is a great resource for anyone looking to buy ethically sourced clothing. They ran a similar article to this one
1916.) In 2017, female doctors were paid an average of $105,000 less than their male counterparts: https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/14/news/economy/gender-pay-gap-doctors/index.html

This 2018 article breaks down the gap by field in Engineering (spoiler alert: men out-earn women in every one): https://alltogether.swe.org/2018/04/pay-gap-in-engineering/

"The truth seems to be that, once relevant confounding factors are accounted for, male and female CEOs earn similar compensation", according to this 2018 paper: https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/04/21/is-there-a-gender-gap-in-ceo-compensation/

All of the above were on the first page of Google results when searching for "female male wages [occupation]". It took me less than a minute total to find all three of those articles. 

In addition to the above, you can check out the US Census for more info on the wage gap by occupation: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/industry-occupation/median-earnings.html

Interestingly enough, the 2017 data for that table does show that the average female CEO makes 74.7% of what their male counterpart makes. I didn't read much of the last article I linked, so I am not sure of what the "relevant confounding factors" are that they are alluding to.
1917.) No one can read this
1918.) The truth reveals itself
1919.) Do you have any info if this is the case in countries in Western Europe?

1921.) Any sources to show examples that people of different genders, in the same profession/company, make more/less?

1928.) Did you mean conquer? Well, if they do manage to reach the summit then that's another 2 females added to the list of people that have climbed Mt. Everest which is a huge accomplishment. But, the point about woman wearing white clothes, no jewellery and eating only veg meals is terribly wrong. These are all traditions of Brahmin and other ethnic groups living in the hills and Terais, but definitely not people like Sherpas who live in the north.
The actual practice is that woman wear white clothes and no jewellery on the year that her husband died while the immediate family will not celebrate any festivals that year and no have salt during the mourning period which is 13 days.
1929.) I'm not sure how I feel about this...
1930.) If I were in your situation, I'd send him a message explaining why this is hugely problematic for you, and see how he responds.  


If he respects you at all or has any sense of empathy, he might get it. He may apologise and work to be better - a surprising amount of people have this hugely reactionary mindset when faced with what they call 'PC' culture (or, being a decent human being), with no context for how it actually impacts people to act like that. If he respects you, that context may help.  


If it doesn't help, I'd tell him that you can't maintain the a friendship with him because his mindset is one that makes women feel unsafe, and it's not something you can ignore.  


Though, full disclosure - I'm a guy, so my approach may not address some of the concerns a woman with lived-in experience might have of this.
1931.) As an American man who once had similar attitudes on rape jokes, I would echo what someone else said in this thread and just tell him how it makes you feel. 

There is a culture that trivializes rape and it's hard to see it in that more serious context if you aren't taken out of it and put a human face to it. It sometimes just takes someone talking to you about these things to make you look at them from a different perspective. See how he reacts. It may not be immediate, and you will have to weigh out how important the friendship is to you and the work it will take to change his views against the the hit your mental health will take to do so. 

That said, I think it's worth it. People can and do change. They sometimes just need a little help.
1932.) I would bring it up to him. I would ask is saying you would rape a person something you would consider a compliment? I am very curious what his answer would be. We need to speak up in these instances or nothing will ever change. 
He needs to know you are upset by it and why. He needs to be told. If we lose friends for standing up for what is right so be it.
1933.) [removed]
1934.) Not to be pedantic, but the increased ability of women to stand up for themselves *does* mean "norms" have changed. "Norms" are not the same as rights; a "norm" just refers to a shared social reference point, often identified and critiqued from a perspective of moral interest. So, where norms are wrong, ethicists (such as feminists) try to *shift* norms, such as the way that the standards for acceptable behavior in the workplace have shifted dramatically over the last few generations.
1935.) Honestly being touched is so jarring. I am a man and it happens less than once a month, but it always shocks me when someone puts their hand on my shoulder or grabs my arm to grab my attention. I can only imagine it happens 100 fold more for women, and the belly rubbing of a pregnant woman is beyond rediculous.
1936.) Joe Biden GANG
1937.) The amount of convos ive had lately with 'feminist' women who are 'sad no one is allowed to be affectionate anymore' and that 'we can't even hug our children these days' has driven me to the brink.
1938.) Biden is a creep and whoever has his back is no better!
1939.) Being touched inappropriately can essentially be a micro aggression that implies “it’s mine if I want it”. So gross, and a complete violation of human rights.
1940.) Yep for both sexes.
1941.) Nah, man. In this world it is my job that flies out the window whenever I carelessly touch a member of the opposite sex
1942.) And be branded a sex offender the rest of your life* and instantly lose your career path* and be made an outcast of society*
1943.) Orang man bad
1944.) Social norms HAVE changed. Not a lot but they have, you can’t hit women anymore, verbal disrespect isn’t acceptable anymore, can I go on or do I get stopped by the woman extremists in this subreddit?
1945.) Touching females without permission isnt a social norm today
1946.) But they have changed, Womens' privacy and rights have become more respected, also y'all need to realize that most sexual assault cases are either misunderstood or the girl just got really drunk and used rape as an escape. Rape still happens and it's terrible, just less frequently than it's being portrayed.
1947.) No one thinks that touching people without consent is okay if it is in any way sexual, but tappning somone on the shouldef or arm happens equally to both genders and is equally annoying to respective parties so I think perhaps this one you guys should just drop.
1948.) What is gray area sex? A woman either consents at a given point in time, or she doesn’t. I don’t mean that to come off as accusatory, but you could you clarify that? It would seem like the options are:

1. The person consents

2. They don’t consent

3. They later withdraw consent, which is the same as #2

4. They consent under false pretenses, which is the same as #2

Are you talking about the legal aspect because that I could sort of see as a gray area in regards to a guilty/innocent verdict. A lot of times guys get off despite a ton circumstantial evidence because he-said/she-said doesn’t meet “beyond a reasonable doubt”. That’s a sort of gray area, but even then the encounter itself seems black and white to me, the evidence is the only issue.

You’re liable to get more responses if you elaborated a bit more on what constitutes a gray area for the purposes of your research. Good luck with your project
1949.) I know some shit
1950.) You didn't say it explicitly, but I think it's worth pointing out: around the same time as Elektra and Catwoman coming out, we got the terrible Daredevil and Fantastic Four movies, both of which starred mostly male superheroes. No one, however, looked at how poorly these movies did and said "well, it looks like male leads just aren't profitable." This is such a ridiculous double standard.
1951.) When I was a kid I hated all movies with women as leads, and TV shows, and it was hard for me to say why. People would tell me it’s because it hated women, but it wasn’t. Now that I’m older the reasons you give above are what I couldn’t articulate as a child - the women were made for men. The sexy outfit, skin tight clothes, normally obsessed with a man, and always seemed to have no female friends because they are so much better than them. The modern films and TVs with women stars and stories are amazing and I love them! I’m looking forward for the next generation of women’s TV with women in mind!
1952.) Thank you for taking the time to write this post. I loved Wonder Woman (haven’t seen captain marvel yet but I hope to soon) and I was quite unfamiliar with the issues around Brie Larson. Very informative and incredibly unbiased post. Well done, and thank you again .
1953.) I was quite interested by the extract from a recent interview with Brie and Chris which seemed to create a lot of drama on twitter because she was really snappy with Chris about a joke I believe.
I've seen quite a few extracts that try to put Brie in a bad light and I feel like it's been a more subtle attempt by people to try once more to give an overly negative view of Brie, which I don't like.
1954.) I think Susan Sarandon bases her ideas on the theory of inertia; that if we get more women in movies, and in these roles, it will snowball.
1955.) people don't like captain marvel because Carol Danvers was not a hopeless woman who needed a man like they make most female leads. get with the times, folks, Women are now being cast the same as men and it fucking rocks
1956.) I hate to say this but while there is a lot of focus on the whole captain marvel fiasco, and I don’t doubt for a second that people may dislike the movie because of a female lead, I highly doubt that’s why it got so much hear.

Because if it did, Alita: Battle Angel would be a failure for the same reason, but it didn’t fit passes with flying colors. And as someone who lurks in both right and left wing circles to see what both sides are saying, most right wing groups have no problem with Alita.

The political message that Brie Larson sent through PR before the films release, while what I personally think that it’s why the film was so disliked pre-reveal. Is a completely different matter that I’m not going to get into.

Unfortunately from what I’ve heard, as well as what the rotten tomatoes audience score is saying. Alita was also a better movie in general.

I feel like captain marvel has blown up an issue that was on its way to being solved, as we are seeing many more female leads nowadays and that number seems to be increasing. And plenty of good movies have come out like Wonder Woman as well. I don’t understand why this one movie is such a big deal when we’ve seen successful movies and other media before. The representation isn’t perfect but it’s definitely improved by miles and is still improving. So why blow this up so much?

1959.) Nobody hated on brie Larson because she was a woman but because she is just an unlike able person. You say that these top critics are white men and I ask you , what is the issue with that. This white men have worked hard to attain the recognition that they have today the race of the critic does not matter and never will , a good movie is a good movie. Cat woman was trash but wonder woman was very successful. You say that now only that there are a high demand for female super heroes but the truth is that the whole superhero genre is only recently gaining demand.

1976.) Unbelievable.
1977.) Good

1981.) That is so fucked up.

Indian folks - How can we help?
1982.) The backlash is totally gross. Bouman has contributed vastly to our understanding of the universe. Coming from a technical field, she has my total respect. I wish people would have given Donna Strickland and Maryam Mirzakhani such praise for the Physics Nobel and Fields Medal, but I guess their work isn't quite as easy to promote to the public.

As a bit of counterpoint, a *lot* of propaganda was quickly churned out to promote Bouman's work and to promote women in science, and not all of it was quality! Most of what I saw was great - "meet Dr. Katie Bouman, the scientist responsible for the black hole image!" As is the fashion with viral news, though, many headlines and graphics used erroneous descriptions that went past hyperbole to describe her achievement (e.g. one graphic that I recall emphasized that Bouman single-handedly created this result and that the news media is actively suppressing her story because of her gender, which just isn't true).. This form of publicity infuriates me, because it *detracts* from progressive feminism. Instead, it provides an avenue of dissent for not only anti-progressives but also for middle of the road people who might react more at the hyperbole than the celebration of a great scientist. Sadly, this very sort of copy is shared by people with good intentions who are more focused on the celebration than anything else.

That all being said, there're a lot of good articles to share, and pushing Bouman's celebration instead of making her into a centerpiece of debate is IMO the way to do it. Show the world how much women in STEM kick ass.
1983.) Physics is at the core of every science, and much of we know of physics, we gained by gazing up at the stars. Elon designed an electric car. It was not the first electric car. And a space ship. It was not the first space ship. He's just a quirky businessman with a future boner. Does Reddit honestly consider him a "scientist"? Lol.
1984.) Elon Musk is Donald Trump for tech bros and Reddit pedants
1985.) And Dr. Bouman exploits zero workers!
1986.) Eat the rich
1987.) I'm just sad to see these two names next to each other, one is a researcher dedicating her life to advancing human knowledge, the other is a billionaire with a pretty face smiling nicely in PR campaigns.
1988.) I'd upvote this twice if I could.

**Alex Howland**, @backslash

Elon Musk: \*Is CEO of SpaceX, Tesla\*

People: "Elon made electric cars! Elon's taking us to Mars! Elon, Elon, Elon!"

Katie Bouman: \*Invents an algorithm to see black holes, leads the team that executes it\*

People: "hold up I mean it was a team effort, why does she get the praise?"

1990.) [removed]
1991.) Bouman absolutely deserves respect and credit. Elon singlehandedly can be attributed for SpaceX and Tesla. Fuck all this pettiness surrounding them, people behind massive accomplishments deserve to be surrounded with praise either way, even if they don't do things entirely on their own.
1992.) I just want to take a moment to say...

WOOHOO! GO KATIE BOUMAN! FUCK YEAH!
1993.) AGREED. But also, I think she has pointed out that it was a team effort, that she couldn’t have done this on her own. Whereas Elon... haven’t really heard much praising of teamwork from him.
1994.) [removed]
1995.) It’s not because she was a woman, it’s because there actually was a team effort behind her, hundreds of people worked on that project and it isn’t worth it to attribute a massive scientific discovery to one single person, however devoted they were. On the other hand, Elon Musk was completely self made, he built his fortune on his own and grew and developed because of that, if it weren’t for Elon HIMSELF, spaceX wouldn’t exist.
1996.) Not a feminist because the feminist in my birthplace is obnoxious.I just can not get why people will discredit dr. Bouman. She is a huge part of the project and the team agrees to let her become the face of the project. The algorithm is her dream and she make it come true( she mentioned her method to get the picture couple years ago in tedtalk) . She is professional and earn my respect(I don’t really like feminist figure like cardi B, Amy Schumer or Hilary Clinton). She delivered her work through act and deserve to be credit in the project. I surely love to hear more about the contribution from other people in the team and let them have their deserved credit, but the fake credit to a man to discredit Dr. bouman is just a fiesta and shit storm. She is a great scientist who is a huge part of a great project, she use her hard work to prove her ability. She deserve respect. Sure , other participant are important and it would be great for people to share the contribution of other scientist in the project , as long as the  information  is true( talking about the pic made by some democrats group I think? Focus only on dr bouman gender and made false claim like the whole project is single handedly lead by her or downgrade her from a phd to a MA and disrespect her profession saying go Katie instead of using a formal respective tone.) it would be great if reddit digs deeper and list other contributor without discredit or undercredit dr bouman just for their narrative.
1997.) Here's the story: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/17/girl-expelled-kneed-boy-bathroom-alaska-transgender

It's all regular high school bullshit that culminated in a kick to the groin by a girl. We have all been there. Expulsion seemed a bit harsh tho, but then again, maybe there was other stuff as well.
1998.) How would you translate the title?
1999.) The men running with boobs had me dying 😂
2000.) [removed]
2001.) I get the point of the post and + but...

To be honest, a bit of me thinks

REG \[clap\]

U \[clap\]

LAR \[clap\]

DAD \[clap\]

Must we make this exceptional?
2002.) So many assholes were posting this pic and calling the dad a cuck. He seems like such a sweet man.
2003.) This is so wholesome, we need more of this! The daughter looks so happy too :’)
2004.) I love this. It’s super sweet and definitely what we should be teaching our children (both boys and girls) but the shirt is just super cringe to me.
2005.) [removed]
2006.) I like the idea and I'm not trying to concern troll but I sort of think that it might be more appropriate when the daughter is teenage or older. This child seems young to be dating at all. I think introducing kids to age appropriate conversations about consent and respect is really really really important but for some reason the shirt just seems in poor taste.
2007.) Can we please make the bars for 'dad of the year' higher than not seeing his daughter as his property?

We would never give women the title 'mother of the year' for wearing a T-shirt outlining stuff that should be pretty basic. So by calling this guy 'dad of the year' we are saying we really expect very little of men. And that is a shame. Because men can be amazing parents and if we want more of them to be, we should probably see that as the normal (as it should be) instead of exceptional.

  


So, great shirt and nice of him. I hope he also is a great dad, and that his childeren grow into happy and fulfilled adults.
2008.) I want to give that dad a hug. I hope more people learn from his example!
2009.) Love this, OP, thank you for sharing!
2010.) oh my god the first line of that shirt triggered my fight or flight
2011.) This is the best thing I've seen all day, I love it so much
2012.) She is obviously not old enough to make the rules. I don’t get it.
2013.) I was with the shirt till it said feminist father. You dont have to spell it out.
2014.) Cringe. This is stating the obvious and we wanna give this guy a cookie for putting on a t-shirt? Good lord let's have a word with ourselves
2015.) What a wonderful and STRONG man to be proud of sharing this message with her and with all of us.

Wonderful father. Super jealous over here!!
2016.) I bet he loves getting dicked with a strap on
2017.) Lmao
2018.) I was genuinely expecting a low quality shitpost before I read the shirt. 
Heartwarming 😊
2019.) Hmm, why is that 6 year old dating?
2020.) Pretty sure both people make the rules in a relationship. But hey this is feminism, what more can you expect?
2021.) Handsome !
2022.) The order should be 4-3-2-1 but it's great in any order!
2023.) At least she has a dad.
2024.) Wow! Great shirt!
2025.) I thought feminism was for equality, we’re way past that now
2026.) Cringe! What a simp
2027.) Cringe
2028.) I get that this man is a nice person and it's clear that he has a warm relationship with his daughter. However, can someone please explain to me realistically why this t-shirt should be praised. Think about it: You're a woman. A guy comes over the house to pick up your daughter and your intuition tells you that this guy is a creep and only wants one thing from your daughter. Are you seriously going to allow this pervert take your daughter out and hurt her! After all, "HER BODY, HER RULES!"? I certainly hope not!

With that said, what difference does it make whether your protector is your mother or your father. A parent who loves her/his child tries to protect her/him! Wouldn't it be better to give the "Dad of the Year!" award to the dad that wears a shirt that says, "I stand behind my daughter 100%!"
2029.) How about both sides work together like any healthy relationship
2030.) What a pussy
2031.) “I don’t make the rules” and that’s why we have 15/16 year olds having babies.
2032.) https://www.reddit.com/r/sequence/comments/bfm5yy/silence_those_liberals/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
2033.) Why girls should be the only one to "make the rules" of a date ??? The boys doesn't "have a body too" ?

BTW as a parent, you have to "make the rules" of the minor child you are responsible of.
2034.) More like cucked father
2035.) Where’s his daughter?
2036.) Orange man bad
2037.) Her body her rules. Isn’t that a little overkill for what looks like a 6 or 7 year old child? can’t the kid just play and not be pulled into this political nonsense. Cool shirt dad, but maybe you should be building your child up socially and emotionally to the point that she won’t date asshole men? When I was that child’s age, I was playing with the moss between the concrete with a stick. Let children be children for heavens sake
2038.) Amazing how a father can look so much like a virgin
2039.) He's not gonna be so smug  when his daughter has a baby at 15 and he's the one who has to take care of it.
2040.) This girls first boyfriend will be able to kick this guys ass.
2041.) But what if she wants to have sex with her dad
2042.) Yes, letting her decide to have sex at what appears to be 10 is sooo progressive.
2043.) So if she wants a baby, but the boyfriend doesn’t, it doesn’t matter? He has to have sex anyway? Doesn’t seem right.
2044.) [removed]
2045.) Aren’t rules 3 and 4 the same?
2046.) Where is the said daughter?
2047.) Not sure about how ethical it is to self identify as a feminist as a man but I mean his intent is good I guess.
2048.) As an anarchist i don't believe in rules. Rules either are enforced or get broken. We need respect and culture. respect to fellow humans, respect to their wishes and wellbeing. everyone deserves the best in this sweet but so seemingly short life.
2049.) At that age children need rules though.
2050.) Shouldn't both of them make the rules as it should be an equal relationship? Not just the girl...
2051.) Do you like men?
2052.) Sadly I don't have any video's for him to watch, maybe some other advice tho. If I were you I wouldn't expose him to any feminism (/left) standpoints, because he'll experience those as "extreme left". Most people when confronted with such wildly different ideas then thereown "lock up" and get even extremer. It might be better to ease him into it. Don't let him watch a playlist just yet. Stupid question, I know, but have you tried talking to him, asking him questions about his points of views? It would be good to know exactly what he is thinking. It is often better to let him do the thinking himself. This way he changed his own mind, he is in charge (or so he will feel),  even though you gave him those ideas.
2053.) Check out r/breadtube for tons of suggestions. For specific people, I highly suggest Contrapoints; she’s a good bridge between these two worlds.
2054.) Watch Wynonna Earp. Feminist and positive LGBT but all wrapped up in a fun kick ass show with smart, witty dialogue so he can't say you're "throwing it in his face" ... that is all.
2055.) Well in my experience there is nihilistic alt-right "everything is bullshit"  black pill, the misleading and often false "everyone on the left and in the mainstream media are a bunch of idiots" alt-right blue pill and finally the outright dangerous "there is a mass conspiracy in the world led by the jews to bring sharia law into our kindergartens which is why girls want make me an incel" red pill.

Now contrary to popular belief it is ill adviced to add pills from the Left in order to counter this. 

These pills are the "western civilization must save the world" green pill , the "feminism is universal" pink pill and finally the "there is a mass conspiracy in the world led by men to make me fail because I am a woman and also some people secretely hate gays and blacks" purple pill.

There are some pills in addition to these such as the "Porn and art are not mutually exclusive" turquoise pill, the "Majority is always correct" gray pill and the "Minorities are morally superior" rainbow pill that both sides tend to ingest in equal measure depending on the situation.

Just like fat solouble vitamins; ingesting a tiny bit of all of these pills regularly is healthy. Eating too much of one thing however is bad. As Ezio Auditore said: "Everything is true. Nothing is permitted"

The cures are as follows:

Black pill:  Access to reliable verifiable and unbiased information 

Blue pill: Interaction or open debate in real life with a moderate smart and sensible member of the left that can provide sensible arguments to single topics (such as yourselves). This applies to blue pilled left as well.

Red pill and purple pill: A newspaper in combination with a vigourous cure for black pill and possibly some real life friends and/or doctor prescribed psychostimulants. 

Green pill: Immigration (and you are the one immigrating)

Pink pill: Living in the countryside for a week without electricity, cars or a grocery store

Turquoise pill : Real life counterparts to the art in question

Gray pill: Hiatus on mainstream social media and comfort zone politics

Rainbow pill: Idiots of said minority

I have no video suggestions for you. I can't be bothered.

2056.) Sounds like indoctrination, let him believe what he wants
2057.) https://youtu.be/8M7KGe2UnmE
2058.) All my guy friends who gets vag on the reg watches contrapoints.
2059.) I’d recommend ContraPoints on YouTube, her targeted audience is young right wing men. Lots of men have credited her for popping the alt right bubble they were in.
2060.) First of all that’s not alt right, second of all if he is the Ben Shapiro watching type asshole then I wouldn’t recommend arguing with him because he will never back down. I’d recommend a more nuanced approach of baiting him into saying something that ends up to be pretty discriminatory. but not in a arguing way. He needs to learn and become self aware himself. As far as you tube videos there’s this german dude called three arrows who’s really good at exposing shit like prager U

Edit: for anything lgbt related, tell him that he shouldn’t give a shit about other people(in context) and how around the world they can be killed for their way of life
2061.) He's either become an incel, or a edgy memer. He's screwed either way.
2062.) [removed]
2063.) He probably shouldn't be watching anything. He needs to get out of the house and make some friends and get involved in some activities that make him feel good about himself. Or maybe show him some articles about the psychology of people who sit around watching alt-right videos all day. Maybe he will not want to be identified with that type?
2064.) What an amazing, strong, and supportive family she had. She was strong, truly a superhero, and her family still supported her even though they were likely attacked for doing so. That is true family love and strength.
2065.) Inspiring.
2066.) heartbreaking
2067.) This story is so horrific that the title alone is enough to bring one to tears. I struggled just to get through the article with each line worse than the previous. It's almost unimaginable that such evil people exist. I hope they hang every one of these evil perpetrators.
2068.) That’s how Mafia works
2069.) Problem countries are: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, Georgia, Hong Kong (SAR of China), India, Republic of Korea, Montenegro, Taiwan (Province of China), Tunisia, and Vietnam.

If heterosexual dating was game the lads living in these countries will be on hardcore mode for the next couple of years. Thank God hentai exists!
2070.) That’s a cooncidence
2071.) Ah yes Democrat propaganda for 2020. Never mind the weapons sales or the rising national debt or the opoid crisis. Our leaders have vaginas now and it is going to change everything.
2072.) > *ERBIL (Kurdistan 24) – A Kurdish woman from Kirkuk Province on Wednesday received her driver’s license for large trucks, becoming the area’s first female motorist to be awarded the hard-earned document.*  
>  
> *Acquiring a general-type license requires testing that is much more difficult in comparison to the rest as holders are allowed to drive any range of vehicles, from light to heavy, including taxis.*  
>  
> *Since it is not widely accepted in the country as a whole for women to operate heavy vehicles or taxis, it is a rarity for female drivers to try out to obtain one.*

2073.) They have multiple all-female military combat units too. They're awesome.
2074.) The backlash was about excesive donations to a non critical social function, yes? 

(Also: the tits on that woman with the purple dress. Dayum!)
2075.) Most important quotes for the article.

>In the meantime, the cascade of cash that materialized overnight to save the cathedral has raised eyebrows in France, still in the throes of a crippling protest over rising social inequality 

There are huge amounts of african and middle eastern immigrants who have no shelter and barely any food to get by while white people hoard everything in paris resulting in a massive amount of inequality. I just can;t believe it.

>“If they can give tens of millions to rebuild Notre Dame, then they should stop telling us there is no money to help with the social emergency,” 

>“In just a few hours today, 650 million euros was donated to rebuild Notre Dame,” South Africa-based journalist Simon Allison tweeted. “In six months, just 15 million euros has been pledged to restore Brazil’s National Museum. I think this is what they call white privilege.”

White people should be completely ashamed for what they have done. I guess white privilege should be counted as a disability because I can't for the life of me wonder why so many are blind.  

Also, I know the I inserted a little bit into the headline that is not part of the article headline. If it is a mistake I will change it but I will admit that I made it a little more attention grabbing(thought truthful) because I was unconfident the original title alone would suffice to interest women in this subreddit. Wanted eyes on this story about greed. White people exploit women and then these are the only times we ever see their wealth be used for something. I shake my head at this.
2076.) Interesting you could practically switch the "bad" and "good" body types around for an ad today as our beauty standards have changed since then, yet the evo psych crowd will continue to yammer on about how it's all down to thousands of years of evolution, health and fertility markers, etc. and men just can't help these deeply ingrained feelings...

No. It's about cultural ideals.
2077.) What the fuck is wrong with that school? People shouldn't corner people just because they think other people don't belong in the bathroom, and self defense is a perfectly reasonable response to such actions. Schools do not watch out for children's safety, do they?
2078.) I just read the article and would clarify that they apparently blocked, not locked the door.

However the reason for the boys going to the bathroom make this story even more ridiculous, as they tried to protest against transgender boy who used the boys bathroom. Here is a related Twitter thread for anyone interested: https://mobile.twitter.com/savannahmoisan/status/1116817585389989890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1116817585389989890&ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc
2079.) Boys will be boys, right? And women will be punished for fighting back.
2080.) Okay, why aren't her parents pitching a goddamn fit to the school board? Because I would take the school administration and go right on up the district chain to include the superintendent and the School Board. These boys trapped this girl, she was rightfully terrified, and she defended herself. THEY should all be expelled.
2081.) Ahh yes, and it's *trans people* invading bathrooms
2082.) Wtf? I thought Alaska was a “Stand your ground state?” Oh, wait, I forgot what that really means...
2083.) I smell a lawsuit
2084.) What you guys are seeing is zero tolerance fighting policies in play. Mine had one where if you get beat up, and defend yourself, you are also punished for fighting at school. Sometimes worse than whoever punched you.
2085.) She did the right thing. Good for her for defending herself. What a terrifying situation to be in.
2086.) This is just ridiculous
2087.) # get this principle and superintendent fired, plus any teacher involved with suspension/expulsion
2088.) I accidentally read the title as “sacred girl” and now I want that to be what we call all trans women who are proud enough and brave enough to be themselves in high school.
2089.) Sue.
2090.) this is actually disgusting and makes me, a young female student, so scared for the future
2091.) Girls will be girls
2092.) Fuck that school. Adults, my ass.
2093.) I found this in the Washington Post so it is a legit story. I don't think the school can get away with this, though having worked in public schools for 12 years, I'm not surprised they did it. I'd chalk it up more to school incompetency than anything else.
2094.) So sad that our trans youth can't even go to the bathroom without being scared. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO FIGHT TO FEEL SAFE IN A BATHROOM. This is the stuff that traumatizes trans kids. Why is she expelled? The boy's who did this should be in trouble, not her. My heart goes out to her and anyone else who has ever gone through something like this. <3
2095.) (Im a guy) I've gotten suspended for protecting myself when a bully attacked me. It's not because they are trans, its because the school system sucks.
2096.) We can all agree if this is what happened it's horrible. But is there any better news articles on this? This website seems a bit biased.

2100.) Surely it depends on what the preceeding sentence was?

Example A:
'All men have a responsibility to fight against rape and sexual assault.'

'Not all men are rapists.'
*(real meaning: I don't care about this issue)*

Example B:
'Men are pigs.'

'Not all men are pigs.'
*(real meaning: I get that you're frustrated, but that was a sexist generalization)*
2101.) Agreed 100%. What is most insulting is that this type of response is essentially a “hey, I personally am not like that”. It is more important to protect their egos than to acknowledge that, by defending ALL men (or not all men), they negate a horrible reality that we need to live with day in and day out.
2102.) I feel as though "not all men" is a means of avoiding accountability but to be fair, broad generalizations do not dictate the consensus.  I'm not so sure that pushing back against a generality makes you complicit, though I can understand what you're trying to say.
2103.) I agree with you in theory I'm just wondering... to what extent should we expect people (men?) to crusade for these things? A lot of people are not in positions of power themselves to stand up for what's right, they're just trying to get by. I guess what I'm saying is... I think that the onus should be less on individual men and more on the system and top-down, institutional change.
2104.) "Apathy is a tacit vote of support for the status quo."
2105.) [removed]
2106.) [removed]
2107.) [removed]
2108.) Entirely agreed.

I'm trying even harder now, it's hard to both try to influence your toxic surroundings (my coworkers, etc..) while also prevent being ostracized or labelled which would cut me off and stop them listening. I often have to make baby steps or avoid certain words.

Obviously it's way easier for me as a dude, which is why I'm trying, and I haven't got much to lose.
2109.) A good man should never have to say "not all men".  A good man should already know if he is truly a good man, and the women and other men around him will know he is a good man by his actions, not his denials.
2110.) I thought about this awhile and re-read the original post a few times.

I wonder two things about the "all men": 1) Who is your target audience? 2) What is the purpose of your statement?

If the target audience is feminists and feminist allies, then yeah, you're not likely to get pushback. Males who are feminist will likely understand and know there is no reason to respond negatively.

If the target audience is the specific group that is perpetrating the slight, it's highly unlikely a member of that demographic is going to feel anything but defensive about a general statement like that. It's human nature I think, when ideas which are seen as threats causes us to resist, initially.

It's confusing, is what I'm saying. I don't claim to know a lot about feminism, I'd like to keep an open mind. I'm just not sure what people actually mean when they make general statements. 

And if I'm confused, what is the guy who doesn't follow politics closely but sees the meme stating "men are ....." thinking?

If you just want support then fine. Many of the subs dedicated to political issues are exactly that. If you want people to engage in honest and difficult discussions, well, it might be valuable to self reflect on the efficacy of such strategies.
2111.) [This](https://imgur.com/a/v5B0RWN)
2112.) I think the fact that it you believe it is "all men" (which I happen to agree with) shows it is not necessarily the fault of all individuals males but a societal and historical issue.

It becomes increasingly difficult for people to accept their behaviour when we approach the situation with pure antagonism. I believe the most prudent course of action is to slowly and painfully deconstruct and thus unravel the patriarchy and its intersecting solidifiers to them.

&#x200B;

I doubt men do not "care"; rather, they have trouble accepting something so horrible and painful.
2113.) Listen, it isn't fair for me to be compared to rapists, thieves, adults. I am 14 years old, why should I be considered a problem because some other people of my gender are a problem? It's not like women can't rape as well.
First of all, it's their parents' fault for not teaching them right.
Second, the developed world already knows that rape is bad. Almost everyone who didn't change now probably won't change anymore (sadly..), unless they recieve the proper punishments. Now, we need to take action on the least developed countries - but for some reason we keep on focusing on the West. 
Third, I refuse to be dishonored because of other people's actions. I've never hurt any woman, and I am still considered a rapist because I am a man?

"War. Murder. Rape. All of those three words have one thing in common. Men." I am pretty sure most people recognize this sentence from a video on YouTube. It even was an advertisement. Now I have nothing related to any of those things, so yes, not all men are rapists. Not all men are bad people. Not all men. And not all women. Especially, *not all humans.*
But that doesn't mean I don't care. I will always teach and help my friends, my family, and hopefully my future wife and kids to avoid being rapists, killers, thieves...and I'll do what I can to raise awareness for those problems for the people I see.
It's a question of individualism and self-respect. I'm not a bad person just because I want to defend myself from other people's attacks. 

I'm sorry if you disagree with me. But I just want to prove I am a good person. And how do I do that online besides of telling you I am not a bad person just because I am a man?

(A good day to the sub and the OP. I'm sorry if I sound aggressive on any of the sentences, just a little frustrated.)
2114.) Men: ***NOT ALL MEN!!1!!11!!!1***

Also Men: Overly protect their daughters
2115.) [removed]
2116.) [removed]
2117.) We ALL currently participate in patriarchal systems, even us die hard feminists.  I feel like i learn this more and more every day.  Dismantling systems requires healthy self reflection, uncomfortable criticism, and hard work.  

"Not all men" proves the speaker isnt willing to do any of that.  Its not helpful.
2118.) “Not all men” but then ask them for their views about men/boys in regards to their daughters dating. Suddenly generalizing all men is ok?
2119.) Crossposting from Ask Feminists because I think it belongs here. 

“For me it’s like this.  

I’m an American. When I travel, people often say to me, oh, Americans are all fat/eat a lot of hamburgers/never leave their home country/can only speak one language — whatever stereotype you get. 

Now, I, personally, am/do none of these things. That does NOT change the fact that most Americans do eat hamburgers, 2/3 of us have never had a passport, 2/3 of us are overweight or obese, more than 80% of us speak only one language, etc. 

I am NOT going to get all butthurt by these comments or insist that they don’t apply to ME, because I know I’m personally not really the topic of the conversation.  And they are pretty much true of the majority of Americans. 

It should be the same for men.”
2120.) "Not all men" is just the "No true Scotsman" fallacy and is used quite commonly used in many situations. If a person were to use the acronym ACAB(all cops are bastards) you can be sure a very similar quote of "not all" would come rather quickly but just like your statement they are simply washing over the problem of bad cops getting away with awful acts because hey, "not all cops are bad"...

That is just my example to go along with your point anyway...
2121.) The "not all [x]" shit just comes off like the people saying it think they're immune to the effects of being born, raised, and living their whole lives in a world that constantly bombards us all with propaganda. No single person is to blame for patriarchy but no single person is going to be able to avoid participating in society while existing in it either, we all have expectations forced upon us and it can be difficult to act outside of those even when we want to.

It's all of us, it's everyone, men are a part of everyone, everyone includes me, everyone includes you, raise your hand if you've got nothing new to learn. If your behaviour is perfect all the time please say so I would love to meet the actual reincarnation of christ.

Every time a minority says "fuck my oppressor they suck" instead of taking it as a learning opportunity it just has to be interpreted in the most disingenuous way possible. Pretending it's a personal attack to avoid having to acknowledge the system it's really talking about is incredibly see-through. Trying to flip it around on the person and calling them "man hater", "anti-white", "trans cult", or whatever other nonsense while simultaneously dismissing or drowning out their complaint outs chuds instantly but it's still obnoxious.
2122.) Here is what I don't understand. If it truly is All Men, then who exactly is the target audience of your complaint? Surely, it's not women because as you've stated, men are the **only ones** who can stop this. Surely it's not the direct perpetrators because that's who you are trying to stop. Surely, it's not those who subvert your point with grammatical semantics because they are complicit and therefore included among All Men.  And surely, it cannot be those true "good men" who posses the power to stop all of this because according to the phrase "All Men", they don't exist. 

If you truly think that men are the **only ones** who can act on the behalf of women and stop all of this, why in the world would you campaign behind a phrase that paints every. single. man. as a monster? That is just ludicrous. You're not supposed to insult someone before you ask for them to save you.

Would that mean 5hat all mean believe it is and have yoda speech even in text? No!

2128.) Wow, what a toxic way to view 4ish billion people. To generalise a sex is sexist, unless you have asked everyone in sed sex and they have all confirmed your accusations or you have hard evidence of that accusation.

Of this is feminism then I'm not for it, I'm for equality for everyone.
2129.) The problem with men who love "not all men" argument is that they don't recognise, do not realise hierarchies around them, because they fetishise their life expirience over some social tendencies, that should be questioned to move forward. They can't even question their lifestyle.

Sticking to old rules, being  is much easier than changing yourself to better.

In fact, reactionary ideology usually fetishises "personal life experiences" over generalisations that are not absolute but more or less reflect social reality.

The system of oppression and generally **determines some tendencies that could occur on massive scale**, creating a risk of harassment. So, it's not "nature" to blame, but lack of automation that, in my view, determines human freedom.
2130.) Shut the fuck up. You just see all men as these monsters that rape all woman, but in reality, they aren’t. Most are just trying to be a good guy and live on with their life, and then they see people like you bitching about the most retarded shit ever. Fuck off.
2131.) I feel like that’s the response when men are actually generalized. I agree it’s a very inappropriate response when someone just HAPPENS to be criticizing a man for his wrongdoings. But when all men are being generalized, it’s a problem. I and many other men do support gender equality. Women are just as capable and deserve equal treatment. So to say all men do these horrible things is to alienate the ones who support you. So yes, not all men.
2132.) This feels a lot like when conservatives slam all Muslims any time any follower of Islam commits an act of terror.
2133.) Interesting,

I had an ex girlfriend who tore my heart out and cheated on me repeatedly, she was a really shitty person who had no morals and treated me like I was sub human. Her friends took her side, so by your logic all women are trash?
2134.) True masculinity is protecting and standing up for those that can't. If you don't, then you waste your masculinity. Everyone should be treated equally.
2135.) Everything about this is fucking stupid. Not ALL men doesn’t mean ‘we don’t care’ it means NOT ALL MEN. How stupid are you?
2136.) Hoes mad
2137.) If you say " Men are all pigs" Then we can say "not all men are pigs"

unless you want us to say "All women are just dumb stupid objects that complain about everything" but you guys would get mad for us being sexist when you guys made a sexist generalization about men.

2139.) [removed]
2140.) I’m going to guess that these are fairly new ideas to you that you are still working on and try to be helpful. I’m with you up to your antepenultimate paragraph, which is seriously problematic and, though I don’t think it was your intention, runs dangerously close to erasing the notion that women are human beings who make decisions, take actions, suffer consequences, and live in the world. That whole paragraph confuses ego with bodily autonomy, is not helpful for your main point, and needs to be drastically rethought. Consent does not have conditionals, as you are arguing for; it is continuous and affirmative. You are blurring the lines by confusing the act with the pretext. Tricking people is wrong, regardless of context, but it is a different wrong than rape. Violating someone’s bodily autonomy takes their ability to make a choice away. Tricking someone is different. If I tell you I need five dollars because I am starving and don’t have any money for food, and you give me five dollars, but I use it to buy drugs, I have tricked you and that is not a nice thing. But I did not rob you of your ability to make a choice. I didn’t forcibly take the five dollars from you. I didn’t violate your bodily autonomy. I hope you can see the difference in this less horrible example. I know what you are going for, but it is enough to say tricking someone into sex is wrong without equating it to rape. As for your second point, not everybody fucks the same, and humans like to discuss that. Some women like to just lay there and some men do, too, and that is totally fine and others are totally fine with it not being their thing and discussing it with their friends. I can tell that your concern is in the right place, but instead of making judgements about the woman in that case, let’s focus on determining if there was consent and leave the judgements about sexual preferences out of it.
2141.) When a woman says "All Men are..."

You have just given every man listening a reason to stop paying attention to you and your ideas. I certainly do, as I know I am faced with a person incapable or unwilling to offer a nuanced and thoughtful exposition of her point, and debases her position by gross over-statement.
2142.) Actually the term not all men is true. Not all men are murderers. Not all men are abusers. Not all men are rapists
2143.) Man:does something bad
Feminists:omg guys this guy is such a monster
Woman:does something bad
Feminists: sits in corner and remains quiet
2144.) How is other men's actions my fucking responsibility? There's a lot of entitlement and toxic femininity that you could "do something about" but don't and you don't hear anybody freaking out about it. Why? Because that would be insane to do. Nobody is obligated to "fix" other people's behavior because a vocal minority finds it unacceptable.
2145.) All women are egotistical, narcissistic assholes.
2146.) When we say not all men we don’t mean we are good we just mean whe are nit what you are saying that is :p
2147.) I don’t get it... I want a simple answer to this. And why is it only the mans problem? It’s not like they’re the only people that are bad... I honestly hate myself for being a man because I am ‘grouped in’ with people who are rapists, liars, discriminators and misogynists.
2148.) >" **Zura Karuhimbi had no weapons to defend herself when the men waving machetes surrounded her home, demanding she hand over those she was sheltering inside.**  
>  
>She did, however, have a reputation for magical powers.  
>  
>That reputation, and the fear it engendered in the group of heavily armed men, was enough to keep an elderly woman and more than 100 others safe during the Rwandan genocide. Some 800,000 other Tutsis and moderate Hutus would die in the ethnic violence which engulfed Rwanda in 1994 - including her first-born son and a daughter.  
>  
>"During the genocide, I saw the darkness of a man's heart," [**she would tell The East African two decades later from the same tiny, two-room house she hid so many people inside**](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/rwanda/News/At-almost-100-Zura-still-has-a-vivid-memory-of-1994-killings-/1433218-1740448-j1tymvz/index.html)."

&#x200B;

women are are often denied traditional paths to power, and Zura saved many using what was available - the deep suspicion and fear of witchcraft. As with many historic women, she accomplished something remarkable with very little power. Working within the system to create good,  at the risk of her own life.
2149.) The thing that most bugs me about lifers is that they're usually the same crowd that moans and whines endlessly about " muh taxes muh taxes" for any program designed to help a single mother care for a child, snap, medicaid, afterschool programs, teachers pay, anything to help kids, the same people who cheered when the administration took kids from their parents and put them in cages, the same people who pass judgment on a woman who would give up her kid for adoption "how could you let your child go", the same people who dont want to talk about ways to get the shooting of children in schools under control, and the same people who support the death penalty and excuse the police literally murdering people. If you ask them, well you cant have, an abortion, you dont think a mom is entitled to any help that might marginally increase your precious taxes, you dont think they should be given up for adoption, just what are your solutions? Chastity....they aren't pro life. They are anti life and pro birth only. They dont give a shit about life after birth.
2150.) *Don't tread on me*. But also, please impose legal restrictions on what women can freely do with their own bodies.

*Don't steal my money with taxes.* But also, force women to have babies they can't support, and then remove programs like planned parenthood. 

*Don't KILL fetuses.* But go ahead and kill [150 million](https://sentientmedia.org/how-many-animals-are-killed-for-food-every-day/) animals every DAY, even though pigs undeniably have higher consciousness and [ability to feel pain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201506/pigs-are-intelligent-emotional-and-cognitively-complex) than a fetus. 

Pro-life is terrible. I do not respect those who adhere to it.
2151.) I honestly believe that my Mom should have aborted me though.
2152.) is that donald?
2153.) When you’re not the one who can get pregnant.
2154.) Such a tough choice,  there'll never be common ground.
2155.) I always wonder if these so-called prolifers realize that women can die in pregnancy and childbirth. No one should decide for another if they should put their life on the line.
2156.) And the one feeding a child for 18 years.
2157.) Oh look another man dictating what a woman can do with her womb. When men evolve to have a uterus, then they can have a say over what happens with their own 👍
2158.) Shouldn't it be it's easy being a pro life when you're not being killed cause the unwanted pregnancy can kill both the mother and the baby
2159.) Must be so easy to go around claiming that heartbeats are a symbol of life when you’re not the one being forced to carry the pregnancy to term. Or go around saying life is a gift and forcing teenagers to drop out of school to take care of children. That’s because it’s easy to force choices on people rather than let people take responsibility for their actions. It’s easy to want to preserve life when you don’t have to do anything but write a placard and stand by the roadside for a few hours and then go to your local bar, have a few drinks before going home to find that your wife cooked, cleaned, took children to bed, prepared their lunches and helped with the homework and didn’t force you to get involved since it’s a choice to be present or not because raising children is a woman’s job and it requires minimal effort on your part.
2160.) So damn true!
2161.) I'm pro choice but glad my parents were pro life.

As others noted, if more were done to support young mothers, I think you'd have more come around to support the pro life pov. Often the pro life crowd communicates "what about the child???" When it's a fetus. But when it's born, it's not their problem anymore.

There should be better support programs in place, better education on the subject. I see the woman's point of view there.

2163.) "being Pregnant" lol noob
2164.) If you don't want the kid put it up for adoption it's as simple as that or if that doesn't work for you just don't have a kid
2165.) Shut up murderer! Oops I mean, pro-abortion woman.
2166.) If your performing sexual acts with your partner your choosing to take a risk of pregnancy. You don’t choose how or when your born, to act like its the same is morally idiotic.
2167.) I mean, let's be honest here. Even I, being pro-life myself, think a lot of pro-life protests are unnecessarily graphic and antagonistic. This one actually seems pretty chill on both sides, which I can appreciate.
2168.) This photo literally destroys your whole argument if you read right to left. SINCE WHEN HAS BEING PREGNANT BEEN WORSE THAN BEING KILLED?! Would you pull a baby out of a mother's womb then slit it's throat no? Because that's murder! But if you can't see it it's not murder right? It's part of the mother's body isn't it? What this is saying is that women nowadays are choosing to be lazy and complacent and rather than bearing with the burden of childbirth as their mother did, they choose to kill their children.
2169.) The ironic thing is neither will ever be pregnant
2170.) Put it up for adoption, seriously, if it’s that big a deal and it’s life threatening then possibly, but for fucks sake, don’t abort, that is a living human
2171.) I get both sides.....
2172.) Itxs easy to be pro-life when the guy has no say and the court systems always rule in favor of the mother regardless of circumstances.  It's always "My body, my choice" with pro-choicers.  Yet the man has absolutely no say in the matter regardless of if the woman chooses tonkeepnor abort it.  You want pro-choice?  Fine, men want 50% of the votr.  If he doesnt want you to hsve it and you do, forgo all child support.
2173.) Not really the most solid argument. I know plenty of women that are pro-life, and would much rather adopt out.
2174.) [removed]
2175.) The excellent Gemma Chan comments on aging, racism and other issues in this Glamour article. From the article:

>It isn’t lost on Gemma that on the Captain Marvel press tour, sitting alongside her costars Jude Law and Samuel L Jackson and being asked approximately one thousand questions a day, she doesn’t get the same line of questioning as a man. Is anyone going to ask Jude how he’s dealing with the ageing process? Actresses have to navigate this line of questioning every single day.

>“Discussions around ageing have been a way of controlling women, making women feel insecure about ourselves and as if they aren’t adequate,” Gemma says. “We need to change things, especially in the beauty industry. The ageing process is going to happen to all of us – how are we going to deal with it? I think ‘anti-ageing’ is a prehistoric term.”

>Gemma is a realist when it comes to her own feelings on the subject. “Obviously, I will probably have a huge freak out about it,” she confides. “I completely recognise that I work in an industry where your looks and your appearance do play a part in what you get cast in, for better or for worse. It’s going to be tough but at the same time I hope that I can deal with it with some grace. If you have enough in your life that you are invested in, that you care about beyond the surface, I think you can deal with it. If you only care about the superficial and appearances, then you are setting yourself up for a fall.”
2176.) Whoa, whoa BIGOT, you know you're not allowed to say anything against Muslims or Islam. You're supposed to disregard any and all proof that Muslim countries are overwhelmingly terrible for literally anyone, but especially women. Bad feminist!
2177.) I was reading this article in the morning. I loved it. I’m a tall, curvy woman, so I understand being an outlier might mean occasional discomfort in some areas (buying bras is tough, almost nowhere has trousers in my size). What this article highlights is that women (**51% of the population!**) are treated as design and research outliers, and the results are not just annoying - they’re potentially life-threatening. This cannot be stressed enough. Kudos to the author, and hope this is something that gets discussed more often.
2178.) I really liked this article! Only recently I started to read and think about feminism and thought that most things were far from my bed (white female in western Europe from a decently well off family without ever having had major issues), then I read this article and oh my god! So many things are just not right. Now I'm reading more and more and looking around me and seeing way more things where equality is still non existent!
2179.) Generally cause we're seem as outsiders so it's like an extra name to let us know that we are outsiders
2180.) I like to identify as a girl (or enby) gamer because I'm sick of getting scolded by male slurs all the time and being congratulated by "dude". The downside is the sexual harassment.
2181.) >40k upvotes

jesus. imagine upvoting this
2182.) Heh I was raised by my Gamer Dad and he did understand online games cant be paused and he still didn't care.
2183.) This is a little silly, the point of the post is that more and more women are playing video games.

In that case, the descriptor 'gamer girls' is cringey and lame but it's not inaccurate
2184.) Gamer girl used to be common synonym for an E-thot idk what it means now
2185.) What about female gamers who don't want to have kids? There is so much wrong with this meme.
2186.) Its a meme
2187.) Jesus you guys get so triggered at everything. The joke is that mother's usually call their children down while they're gaming, and that is usually what happens. Probably no one has happened with this with their father (not saying anything about gender roles just personal experience). If anything, feminists put a gender at the end of everything for things such as stem related jobs and such, I don't see how this is any different, especially in a make-up on are activity. Calm down, they aren't advocating for sexism.
2188.) Also the alliteration is killer. Gamer Women doesn't sound as nice!

Also dads being assumed to not parrent gets my goat
2189.) Yeah they can’t do things without having to put a gender at the end. Because most gamers are males, just like how most athletes are males. So what’s wrong with putting “girl” in the word to help identify the smaller group?
2190.)  Us gamers do this as a sign for respect, in the gamer nations (with an S at the end) it is considered that having a gamer girl means that you should treat her with respect because like i said long time ago if a species have a power then for that species it is not a power but more of an ability but lables and privillages make it so
2191.) It's a meme. Imagine being so upset by a meme you have to goto a website and write about how much it upsets you...

This was obviously made by some 12/13 year old kid who was annoyed that his mom kept telling him to come down for dinner.
2192.) That first part, sure they can. But if you are speaking about a female gamer, then it makes it easier to understand, for example "my friend is a gamer", is a sentence where the gender of the person isnt specified. But if you said gamer GIRL then you would understand its a girl, and thats why the term even exists. Also men can raise children
2193.) This might be because they are a minority only 6% of women indentify as gamers and 15% of men do.
2194.) If you ever get on any major AAA title on the multiplayer, odds are you’ll encounter more males than females. I’m not insinuating anything, but what I’m thinking is that they specified the gender to make the image more relatable. This is ironic because this post is trying to praise women who play games as more understanding of a predominantly male hobby but still ended up pissing people off
2195.) Maybe because for every gamer girl there are 70 guys
2196.) It specifies "girls" because thats what the meme is about. If it was about doctors who are gamers then it would say that instead.
2197.) It's kind of like mansplaining and manspreading
2198.) Okay so this post is fucking idiotic and here’s why.
1. Mansplaining manspreading and so much more I can’t be bothered to learn.
2. It is a joke that mothers interupt their child who is playing a online game then tells him to pause it, it was on south park once and tbh don’t even get started on your shriveld husk you call humor that isn’t allowed to joke about anything verging on offensive even though its obvious no one supports any of the things in the joke.
2199.) Because when something is a minority it tends to have extra context, doesn’t take a genius
2200.) What are you some sort of feminist
2201.) [removed]
2202.) Idk Gamer Girls is a meme. “Gamer girl pee is my g-fuel” or you hear that slightly female voice in your CS:GO lobby and you whisper to your friends in discord “holy shit it’s a gamer girl.” Tbh I feel like this sub needs to loosen up. I always get a laugh out of the ridiculousness of OMG ITS A FUCKING GIRL EEEEEE.
2203.) We are just girls who play games so we are gamer girls. What is the problem? They just wanted to mention women. They don't say that women are the ones who raise the children. They just say they can understand that an online game can't be stopped. They don't say gamer girls because they are women and they can't, they say gamer girls because some people who play games complain about their moms telling them to stop an online game because they don't understand. Dads say that too but most of the gamers complain about moms but they don't really complain, they are joking. Wow. Why are you so picky? Can't you just enjoy a post?
2204.) The only thing wrong with that meme is the idea that your mum should give a shit that you can't pause your game. You live in her house, you'd better follow her rules.
2205.) Fuck this shit post
2206.) the entire reason that gamer girls are called gamer girls is cause it's mostly guys who plays video games, of course girls can play video games nobody said they can't.
2207.) [removed]
2208.) Women can drive in SA now?
2209.) That's terrible.
2210.) Im more of a conservative than a leftist and i really wanted to see what this sub was about since feminism is a more leftist thing because i wanted to see a different point of view. I go on and i see this. I thought you guys were for equality not for this shit. But what do i know since ill probably get a lot of hate.
2211.) This feels like a double-standard to me
2212.) Good
2213.) Came here to be like "man this guy's got a way with words" before I realized who wrote it.
2214.) Shouldn’t he be using that time and energy to write something else....
2215.) wHy DoNT wOMEn RePoRT StaLKinG ANd SeXUaL aSSAulT??
2216.) “When we looked at the circumstances leading to Shana’s murder, we felt we may not have done the very best we could,” Sussex Police Assistant Chief Constable Nick May said in the statement.

You think?
2217.) I hope everyone one directly involved in her case get 10 days off w/o pay. And gets reassigned to desk duty someplace. I hope her parents file a wrongful death suit, against the PD and City. You know they are not going to fire these officers.
2218.) I know we shouldn't have to but this is why we need to learn self defense. In my life I have had to break one attempted rapists arm and knock out a stalker. In the end the police wont protect us only we can.
2219.) 40%
2220.) fAlSe ACcuSaTiOnS
2221.) That isn't right.
2222.) [deleted]
2223.) Prior to this case, they had 13 other complaints, from 3-10 years ago and they claim they misunderstood what stalking was? 

Also she was fined for not disclosing she had been in a relationship with him??! As if NOT being in a relationship with someone doing this shit is somehow more actionable and worse? Wtf is that logic even
2224.) this is really fucked up. it really does show systematic sexism that is so true and real and horrific. women NEED to be taken seriously, it’s quite literally life-threatening that they aren’t getting the response and treatment they need
2225.) Hope he rots in hell, calling him a pig would be a compliment
2226.) Why does reddit show me trending posts on subreddits im not subscribed to. I don’t care about this shit. I just wanna browse memes and stay up to date on games. I don’t wanna see this.
2227.) All Cats Are Beautiful.

Either people don't get that I'm saying ACAB or anti cop rhetoric is disapproved of here?
2228.) Yesterday, I was talking g with my brother about how a movie maybe feminist. He said "it's not feminist, there's no men bashing". 

I was so surprised to hear that from him. I told him that feminism wasn't men bashing and that he needed to spend less time on alt-right YouTube channels.
2229.) "I'm not saying I'm right. It's just how I feel."

There's really no responding to that kind of mindset.
2230.) I'd probably go with "Uhuh" and move on. No point in debating those who don't want a debate.  If he kept insisting I would say something along the lines of "duly noted. You can either stop mentioning it or start debating".
2231.) You don't bother with him. What he describes is clearly not feminism. So send him a link to a YT video that says what feminism is actually (guys like that never read articles) and move on.


I never talk with my brother about social subjects at all because of this.
2232.) It must be nice to be part of a group where the biggest threat to your rights and social acceptance is a Harry Potter actor occasionally giving speeches about being nice to others.  


You're brother's acting like a baby, no offense. I don't think you can really engage with that mindset with words. All you can do is keep chugging along until they realize their whining doesn't cause you shame.
2233.) tbh he has a lot of fair points. i'd tell him that emma watson isn't the face of feminism and that she has her faults too. introduce him to some other material.
2234.) It goes both ways ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2235.) Everything he says is correct though.
2236.) You should take the time to understand him and listen to him. Once you understand the core of his issues with what he thinks feminism is you can better help him understand. It’s not like his points were not valid, I mean he does list several real problems, however he needs to realize that women have it worse. Once you understand his viewpoints it’s easier to pick them apart and show him how he has it wrong and it’s just the stuff he watches that makes it seem like it is to him. This isn’t inequality, this is simply a guy that’s pissed at the world and you need to help him.

2238.) He’s not wrong.
2239.) [removed]
2240.) That is just weird. Carrying tampons, or seeing someone carrying tampons, I don't think I would even notice.
2241.) I stopped caring by high school when pretty much all girls have started their period
2242.) Maybe you met a person that didn't grow out of her puberty mindset, I felt a bit ashamed when I was younger as well for buying tampons or condoms, but this normally ends after some time?!
2243.) Just goes to show how society is biased against women and their bodily functions. I saw a story on AITA the other day about a guy asking whether he was an asshole for telling his girlfriend to stop talking about her period, it made me angry because these men sexualize us and want sex on a whim but don’t want us to discuss what’s happening to us. It’s disgusting.
2244.) End the stigma!
Periods are normal. No reason to be ashamed. Period. (See what I did there?)
2245.) I never understood this. I often buy my wife’s toiletries when I happen to be out shopping and she needs them, and I am always a little shocked that so many people make comments like I’m some kind of super hero for grabbing them for her. I often don’t even know how to reply. Like gee thanks for the recognition for buying an item that I don’t use for my spouse? Why is this a big deal? Almost half of the earths population uses these. Why is it significant that I purchase them?
2246.) This is hilarious! Absolutely nothing to be ashamed about.
2247.) What's the context? Is the store located right next to a football stadium or a baby bunting shop? It's hard to tell why it would be "brave" for you to walk out with women's toiletries without knowing what you are walking out to.
2248.) That's a strange perspective of her to have. Was she young? 

I could imagine one being more shy about it when they first get their period.
2249.) It’s because your cashier knows the value of modesty.
2250.) How exactly are shoes with heels safer to wear than flats? I always nearly bust my ass in heels and flight attendants are expected to be able to help passengers in an emergency.
2251.) This surprises me coming out of Norway, but I imagine even without the policy employees would still face pressure to wear makeup and subtle consequences for choosing to wear heavy makeup or no makeup at all. The airline industry is terrible, and as the article states, almost every airline has dated policies like this one. They’ve come a long way since the 90s when my mom was a flight attendant and was required to adhere to weight regulations (less than 125lb at 5’5”), but they have so far to go.
2252.) Norway is the last country I would expect to do something so moronic.
2253.) This so so absurd and horrendous I can't believe this is a new policy wtf Norwegian
2254.) I was speaking to a female colleague the other day. We were talking about commute times into work (we work in Manhattan). At some point she said "I need 30 minutes to do makeup alone." This caused me to pause as this something I've never thought about. Why would I, being make I'm not expected to wear makeup. I'm expected to dress appropriately, but given I work in education, I can pull off jeans and a shirt.

I'm not aware if companies have similar policies to this airline or it's more that women will wear heels and makeup because this is what they do.
2255.) I get makeup requirements in most jobs and places I work for... always feels awful, always hope this becomes something of the past, didn’t know companies had stopped doing this cause I experience it often
2256.) I’m not sure if this is referring to the airline Norwegian but they are just goddamn horrible to fly with. Forget to give me food I paid for and then required proof. Double charged me for baggage and because they can’t see it on their system, I have to prove to them that they’ve taken it.
They’re a disease of an airline, I’m not surprised they have these ridiculous policies. If you can treat your customers like trash for wanting what they paid for, imagine what they do to their staff.
2257.) If they do those things the bosses think more people will want to travel with them and thus male more money. The nordic countries are capitalist so that sort of contradiction btw capitalism and feminism still exists, everyday. Thats why socialist feminist is a thing opposite liberal feminist
2258.) It’s just a uniform jeez
2259.) Is this not just a basic dress code so that the crew looks presentable?
2260.) Why am I getting downvoted so much for asking sincere questions?
2261.) Is this much different than men having to wear ties or having a specific haircut?
2262.) um, I have, plenty of times. All the time.
2263.) Wait I\`m doing this
2264.) I know it's wrong to touch women like that but that woman clearly don't know about men. They do this to each other all the time.
2265.) THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
2266.) Yeah but girls always do that to me in nightclubs and bars ayy, thinking they’re all so pretty n shit and I want them to touch me... yuck.

2268.) This subreddit
2269.) I do, but I'm European ;) and girls do it to me.
2270.) That is because thats kinda gay
2271.) But women have like bra clips and stuff on their real backs. What if my hand lands awkwardly on it and I prick myself?
2272.) Literally no one does that
2273.)  Are you complaining about being scooched which happens to everyone?
2274.) unless it's from someone attractive... smh
2275.) I can guess but... you mind explain a lil bit what the song says?
2276.) I’d like to see some proof XD
2277.) One of the boys goes “I think boys are clever than girls” uh you sure buddy?
2278.) This is why I get mad when people say we don't need feminism anymore.
2279.) That's awful. I hope she gets out soon.
2280.) What’s the source of this picture and this information? Was there an article about her? I’m not entirely sure but if I remember correctly I think it’s the girl that disappeared about a year ago and people speculated that she got killed for protesting. It made me extremely sad to think what women have to endure in some parts of the world.
2281.) I can't believe the Iranian government arrests people for shit like this.
2282.) Whats the context about this
You dont tell me nothing with this
Link? Anyone?
2283.) Iran needs a new revolution.  The youth need to push this wonderful society toward a European style democracy.  Corrupt old men gave them a theocracy to provide them control in order to do their corruption in the name of Allah.

Before 1979, Iran may have had a corrupt American puppet in the Shah, but Teheran was the Paris of the Middle East.  

Islamic conservatives and American conservatives who need them to create an enemy to fool American Christians we are nearing holy war are killing the world.  Young Middle East: rise up.  Your future and the world need it.
2284.) Wonder how long it will be before women get arrested for wearing hijabs in the US.
2285.) Now this is a true modern day feminist. Unlike those hair died, armpit growing hair, loud idiots in 1st world countries
2286.) That's the culture of the country though.
2287.) What is Jail gor?
2288.) Islamic feminism is an oxymoron. RELIGIOUS feminism as a whole is actually oxymoronic.
2289.) Endorsement of regressive ideologies or practices is strictly forbidden.

In other words: the range of answers that will not result in an irrevocable ban is limited. Please keep in mind that women's issues should not be subordinated to anything else (at least not here), be it tradition or whatever the fuck.
2290.) NO
2291.) I'd say maybe but why bother. Be a feminist instead.
2292.) No.
2293.) I grew up in Bangladesh where sending your daughters/wives to school, or allowing them to work was taboo. Yet, there were women who did those things, and still remained devout Muslims. As a result, religion's stance on this topic was made obsolete over time. Religion evolves with  time, and I think it's important for feminists to identify as religious so that they can introduce feminist ideas in religion.

However, pretending that religion (looking at you "Muslim Feminists") is feminist is laughable.
2294.) I am not going to answer the question directly because debating someone's identity rarely goes anywhere. But if you try to be both a feminist and an Abrahamist, you will have to eventually have to sacrifice one for the other or at least keep silent about a lot of important issues. Since no evidence for anything supernatural has come forward and the world behaves physicalistically, it is best for one to choose feminism, LGBT+ rights, socialism, etc. over religion.
2295.) My religious views are like a Dali painting, sagging, propped up and held together by strings. 

I like to think that the key messages of Christianity have been distorted and erased by successive, male power groups. At the core we find 1.) love one another. 

I also think Stephen Hawking was on to something when he said that if there is a God, she has seemingly set up universal laws of physics which are seen everywhere. In other words, ours is a secular universe. Prayer will not stop the Earth from spinning.

I take this to mean that we should keep our religion away from things like government and formation of societal norms. Worship a shoe if you like but do not try and force that on anyone else. Our world is guided by secular laws.
2296.) When debating this with my partner she made a point that you can interpret the religious texts in a feminist way.

That way it's possible to be both religious and feminist and you can also have positive effects on said religions from the inside.

The other half of the problem is how is it possible to interpret these supposedly perfect texts in so many different ways? But that's a topic for Atheism subreddit.
2297.) [removed]
2298.) This horse has been flogged enough.
2299.) Nobody says that
2300.) I believed in feminism for a long time but I thought that being a feminist meant bashing other genders. When I did research and educated myself at about age 11 or 12, I clung to the label. Feminism means equality - mainly gender equality/equal rights but it can be extended to pro-choice, anti-racism, trans ally, etc.
2301.) >It was shocking that neither main party pointed out he’d evaded facing sexual charges

That's because everyone knows this wasn't the reason he was arrested. He was arrested for exposing US war crimes.

What this piece doesn't mention are the rights of Iraqi women to not be massacred by the US military. This begs the question- can Iraqi women have rights?

Assange personally disgusts me, his politics are probably not feminist, but this issue is much bigger than him. It's about the US war on whistleblowers and journalists in defense of US empire.
2302.) Not really "political parties" per say, but secondary to fascism itself. Cause that's what his arrest is, a fascist attack by the government against a free press which exposes war crimes committed by that government. He's a journalist who is facing criminal charges for informing the public of it's governments actions. Nevermind that there have been zero arrests or charges against the soldiers who actually murdered civilians and first responders. Or their higher ups who ordered them to commit those murders. Or the government officials which sent us into these prolonged, illegal wars in the first place. 

But hey, we can treat prison like a revolving door for Chelsea Manning apparently so... no, I don't actually have a sarcastic quip that one. What the government (both under Democratic and Republican control) has done to her for being a whistleblower is horrific. And now it's spreading to journalists too. Assange's and Manning's arrests are clear cut messages from those in power to the press saying: "shut up and stay in line, or we are coming for you." 

And yeah, Assange is a rapist piece of shit as a person. He deserves to be in jail. A Swedish jail. For raping a woman. In Sweden. But what's happening now has nothing to do with that unfortunately.
2303.) According to the CBC Radio reports I listened to:

The Swedish sexual assault charges had to be dropped because when he was in the embassy, there was no way for Sweden to serve Assange as a part of their due process.

Sweden is *now* looking to re-invoke (or whatever the appropriate term is) those charges.

At the moment, there are no sexual assault charges against Assange so the UK is appropriately processing the extradition request by the US.

The problem is even if Sweden re-enstates the sexual assault charges, they are likely to now be the second extradition request which might mean that US gets priority.
2304.) This thread has made me overjoyed that people are speaking rationally about the larger charges and not calling for his head on a stick for telling the truth about Hillary (even if his timing was rage inducing to Hillary supporters, the truth is the truth. People shouldn't want to kill a man for exposing a truth about an elected official, especially potus.

&#x200B;

edit: I shouldna sayed larger charges other people have posted links that these women are indeed trying to bring back the charges I thought Assange was a hero looks like he's a slimeball, still a good journalist though. at least now I'm not so depressed that he got picked up maybe he'll have to face some real some charges.
2305.) Isn't everything second to political parties at this point though?
2306.) "Ms Phillips later said she received in excess of 600 rape threats in a night."

JFC.
2307.) Background:

The lead MEP being put forward this year by UKIP tweeted saying ‘I wouldn’t even rape you’ to this MP around 2 years ago because she didn’t believe in his views. The leader of UKIP then went on a BBC programme and said he only meant it as a joke....  this isn’t smash or pass, this is dangerous people getting into dangerous power positions, again.
2308.) Jess Phillips is a remarkable person. And an absolute inspiration.
2309.) What the fuck.
2310.) this is so revolting
2311.) That is super fucked (no pun intended)
2312.) [removed]
2313.) a "feminist" told me that if i didn't hate all men and want women to be considered superior, i wasn't a feminist. HONEY THAT'S NOT FEMINISM IT'S MISANDRY
2314.) I was told that thin privilege does not exist.

The exact people who argue about white privilege, male privilege, cis privilege, straight privilege, flat out flipped the switch and used the same **exact** arguments they mocked others for having because they don't want to recognize fat people as the majority being systematically shit on.
2315.) That false accusations of rape in the #metoo era are extremely rare. In point of fact, the only valid inference that can be drawn from the Lisak study is that at a bare minimum, 2 to 11 percent of rape accusations made to police are provably false. Ostensibly this percentage is higher for facebook and Twitter accusations as there is lower barrier to entry. I have seen too many flagrantly false accusations made exponentially worse by knee jerk support from people who dont know the facts. If you want to #believesurvivors or #believewomen as an article of personal faith that is your perogative. But dont misinterpret the ten year old Lisak study to pretend you are being scientific.
2316.) Sex work. And surrogacy. Either way, I don't think it's okay to buy other people's bodies. In both cases there is a small group of (rich) people taking advantage in some way over another person. Not cool with it. I usually just switch to another topic, like being vegan. I eat meat but I agree with vegans in general. And that is some else's sore spot. Jackpot.
2317.) [removed]
2318.) Something tells me all this press and controversy will ensure that the book will become a best seller, instead of fading away quietly as it probably should.
2319.) So, it sounds like you want to run in a world where our gender values are flipped.  Where feminine is inherently more valuable than masculine.  

"Don't be a boy about it" is a put down.  Calling someone a girl doesn't have the same sting.  

The reigning monarch is always a queen, and families are organized around mothers.  You take your mother's name and who your father was is not important.  

The most powerful diety is a goddess, male dieties exist, but are defined by their relationships to goddesses.  Eg: gaia is the world mother.  Goddess of life, nature, magic, and growth.  Herne is her nephew, god of hunting.  

Women hold the positions of power.  They run all the guilds, hold all the hereditary titles, the royal guard is all women because men can't be trusted with such an important responsibility because they are men.  

Violence is illegal not because people are scared of it, but bevause it is a childish, immature, masculine way to solve a problem.
2320.) Unless your friends agreed to this, I don’t see how adding politics into a fantasy board game is going to be fun...
2321.) I wouldn't try to make the game less fun or add politics to a fantasy table top game...
2322.) Not sure about the article’s suggestion at the end that Harry do it. 

He’s not the one giving birth.
2323.) Was gonna reply to the guy who posted the same nonsense OP is about, but he deleted his post for some reason. Anyway here's some updated context. 

> “While I appreciate the congratulations on a result that I worked hard on for years, if you are congratulating me because you have a sexist vendetta against Katie, please go away and reconsider your priorities in life,” Chael wrote.

> Trolls began spreading memes on Reddit and Twitter this week, falsely claiming that Chael wrote “850,000 of the 900,000 lines of code” and “did 90% of the work. Where’s his credit?”

> Chael set the record straight, explaining that Bouman, an assistant professor at Caltech, helped develop the algorithm while a postdoctoral fellow at MIT. He praised her “as an example of women’s leadership” in science and technology fields.

> “While I wrote much of the code for one of these pipelines, Katie was a huge contributor to the software,” Chael explained. “It would have never worked without her contributions and the work of many others.”

> Over 200 scientists worked on the Event Horizon Telescope, a global collaboration that captured the black hole image.

> Chael debunked the claim that he wrote “850,000 lines of code,” explaining that “many of those ‘lines’” are taken from existing “model files.”

> “There are about 68,000 lines in the current software, and I don’t care how many of those I personally authored,” he wrote.

> Chael suggested in his Twitter thread that the sexist trolls appear to have picked him as a prop to support their false narrative.

> “It was clearly started by people who were upset that a woman had become the face of this story and decided, ‘I’m going to find someone who reflects my narrative instead,’” Chael told The Washington Post Friday.

> He added that it “was ironic that they chose me,” because, as a gay man, he is also part of an underrepresented group in the field of science.

> “I’m thrilled Katie is getting recognition for her work and that she’s inspiring people as an example of women’s leadership in STEM,” Chael wrote. “I’m also thrilled she’s pointing out that this was a team effort including contributions from many junior scientists, including many women junior scientists.”
2324.) I feel a great disturbance in the force. As if a million incels cried out with "um, actually..." and dusted the Doritos off their keyboards and started typing.
2325.) The best part is the guy the misogynists tried to credit with "doing the real work" told them to STFU.
2326.) It's hilarious how fragile they are, how their world is crumbling down because a woman did something that a man didn't.
2327.) That’s how you know you’ve made it.
2328.) This is why more women don’t go into stem and exactly the reason why women shouldn’t be put off of a stem career by this type of behaviour .

These guys are loser, they just can’t handle being failures. They want to hate women so show them who the fuck the boss is.
2329.) On a related note if you watch her interviews and Tedx talk you can see she’s really passionate about what she’s doing. I love her smile while she’s giving her interviews, genuinely seems like an amazing person wanting to push boundaries of space exploration and black hole discoveries. We need more people like her!
2330.) It’s so petty that Reddit kicked up a storm about a female getting some well deserved credit. Do you not know how positive this could have been? We need more female representation within STEM - more, “look what you can do” and yet, this project and this method of trying to influence women to get involved with something they’ve been told for years that they weren’t good enough for, has been ruined by incels and sexist idiots hiding behind their keyboards. 

I don’t know why some men don’t understand the lack of representation of women in STEM and why it’s important we start showing woman scientists and woman in games and tech - and it’s not for a movement or to belittle men’s involvement, but damn, we know men are involved - we know there’s a whole team of men just due to stats on how many are involved in STEM. However, it’s crazy empowering to read about a woman who has helped (along with a team, ofc) make history via STEM. I don’t expect a gender (and race) that was never excluded from any career field to understand, but just sit down. 

I feel incredibly bad for the woman involved due to the stupid, immature backlash.
2331.) I’m male and think this woman is great. Seriously, the only people upset about this are folks who get angry about others successes.
2332.) What is wrong with people??
2333.) It’s sad that they are all trying to make excuses and discredit her just because she is a woman. If it was a man I doubt people would frequently bring up the fact “there was a team behind him” or even try to argue he didn’t do much. Fuck misogyny. I’m sick and tired of this bullshit. Yall think that other cientific discoveries made by man didn’t also have a group of people behind it? Did it take away the credit of all those white males we’ve studied about for years? It didn’t, fucker. Fuck you and your shitty half assed argument to try to discredit her work
2334.) I'm so tired of this being the norm on Reddit every single day, then having some front page guy make it about a few bad apples.
2335.) Yes I stumbled into some of this rubbish from the typical sorts of shits. The most brilliant thing is that in her TED talk which probably initiated this latest story, she ends by showing a picture of the full team and clearly stating that it's a team effort. Linking it seemed to do the trick.
2336.) I don't think the public wrath is against feminism, or targeting her because she's a woman.

If you look at the group photo, you will notice that more than 80% of the contributed scientists are men. If you read through the Wikipedia page, you will know that there are >100 of laboratories and scientific institutions collaborated together to achieve this feat. That means it's achieved by THOUSANDS of people, including the men who built the telescope.

The public wrath, from men and women, is targeting the bias in mainstream media which purposedly give ALL the credit to one young woman, purposedly putting her in the focus, while ignoring the hard work of all other scientists, male and female. 

The general public is not stupid, they can sense what ugly stuff the media is trying to sell.
2337.) Haha, wow. Reddit incels are the lowest form.of life on the planet. Hilarious how they got all butt hurt when the guy they were defending "cucked" them hard.
2338.) [removed]
2339.) Is that Brendon Urie in the thumbnail
2340.) And many of her lines are from "model code"
2341.) You do understand memes get made out of literally everything right?
2342.) Fuck me, these reactions is what the “trolls” want, making a new news article about it isn’t going to change anything.
2343.) [removed]
2344.) As much as I agree that the hate she has gotten is absolutely ridiculous I can't see where the misogyny comes from.. I think the hate arouse when reddit descoverd that the media is giving one person the credit when it was a team effort.

Edit: if anyone can cite anything directly showing the misogyny that be appreciated. (I am lazy and didnt read the whole article😳)
2345.) [removed]
2346.) Please keep in mind that no racism will be allowed, under the guise of feigned concern for women's issues. Any instance of racism or xenophobia will be met with a quick and irrevocable ban - this is a zero-tolerance policy.

***

With that out of the way, please keep in mind this guideline for feminist conversations regarding problematic traditions, by considering [this material](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240714229_The_Arranged_Marriage_of_Ana_Maria_Cioaba_Intra-Community_Oppression_and_Romani_Feminist_IdealsTranscending_the_%27Primitive_Culture%27_Argument) about transcending the ‘primitive culture’ argument - the author does acknowledge that a necessary part of such conversations should be:

- acknowledgement that the "model" (Western) culture also has its own deep issues with misogyny (and racism, etc);

- acknowledgement that the "model" culture/civilization has/has had a strong negative influence in perpetuating oppression in the target culture - they are in fact part of the problem;

- painting an entire culture/ethnic group in an intransigent manner forces minorities in that group (including women) to have to choose between their group/ethnic allegiances, and their own issues as women. Quoting Crenshaw, she shows that they often choose the former, resulting in a rigidification of regressive practices - the 'reactive culturalism';

- while the above are invoked/implied in many discussions, the following is too often missing:

>Often, practices that are harmful to women within such groups are
either ignored in the name of preserving cultural autonomy or criticized
in a way that portrays the entire culture as primitive. To deviate from
these flawed approaches, it is necessary to apply feminist scrutiny to laws
and practices affecting women in minority communities. Whites/westerners
should not abstain from critiquing practices involving Third World
subjects, mistakenly believing that they are respecting the ‘other’s’
culture. Uma Narayan comments:

>>It is not clear to me that one can really learn about another culture while not
subjecting it to any critical or normative evaluation, any more than one can
really learn about another person without subjecting her to a variety of
appraisals and evaluations, both positive and negative. Most often the
commitment ‘not to judge’ other cultures seems in effect to be a commitment
‘not to express one’s judgments’ – which only serves to insulate these
unexpressed judgments from challenges, corrections, or interrogations they
might profit from.

Therefore, concern for the oppression of vulnerable groups (such as non-white minorities in Western countries) should not be a stop to valid criticism of misogyny in such groups.

This guideline is meant to facilitate an improvement of discussions here (so that we avoid the shortcomings of both ignoring Western faults, and of ignoring faults in other cultures - neither is justified).
2347.) I think that being growing as a woman conditions us to be more self critical and unsure in ourselves, so I totally think it’s normal, but also an influence of the patriarchy. So growing up with all that self-doubt and then coming into feminism is hard - you’re always becoming more aware of everything playing against you and people everywhere due to misogyny. then not only do you have you’re own personal self-doubt, but suddenly see the structures everywhere holding progression back! So yeah I think it’s normal, but push back!
2348.) The male advantage is limited entirely to having a greater ability to do violence. Historically, the ability to do violence was more important in society (because of all the male violence) and men used it to their advantage against us. Now, being able to hurt people is not so important. Some of them are still bitter about it because they want to feel special. Please don't be silly enough to agree with them.
2349.) Many people feel like this, it doesn’t mean they are crazy
2350.) You're not crazy. There is a lot of internalised misogyny women have that makes them think like this. Studying feminism actually helped me cause it made me realise that I don't have to follow the strict rules I feel imposed on me and I can be who I want to be no matter what I am
2351.) I relate to this. I've been a feminist all my adult life but there's still a lot of internalized misogyny that creeps around deep inside me from my upbringing and experiences in society.  When it comes into my brain in words I can refute it logically, but the feelings are harder to shake sometimes. 

I remind myself that the self loathing that exists is not my fault and what I hate isn't actually myself nor womanhood, but the patriarchal construction of what femininity is "supposed" to be.  I hate what i'm supposed to be as a woman for men, but when I name all that, break it down and remove it I'm much more content with what it means to be a woman and more confident that who I am fits within a more pure definition of femininity.
2352.) Im so sorry you feel that way. I think when you feel like its unobtainable look at how far we have come. At the beginning of the 20th century we couldn't vote. Now we have women in Congress, the Senate cabinet positions and running for president. At the beginning of the 20th century women were expected to stay home and raise kids, now women are c.e.o.s of major corporations and entrepreneurs, we have women who are doing science research and doctors and lawyers. Its not a perfect world yet but we are making progress. We are moving forward. Right now metoo is smashing the normalization of sexual harassment. Look up sister its not hopeless we are winning in the long run. 

I just need to give a shout out to my dad who raised me to believe I can do anything, who encouraged my love of things that were "boys things" like martial arts and video games. He taught me I had value outside of being a wife and mother and that I owed no man anything. He taught me I was more then my face boobs and womb. We have men like my dad now who taught his daughter to be strong not settle be a bad ass. 

Its not hopeless. Women and men like my dad ARE changing things. They have changed things. We are moving forward. Dont let old world thinking get you down sister. That is dying. We may not live to see the world where its completely gone but we live in better world then our great grand mothers and grand mothers did.
2353.) Am a girl trying to have a career in STEM. Trust me, it's not just you, you're not crazy. This is a consequence of oppressive forces that go a long way back in our history. They are being exposed more and more on a daily basis and things are getting better. I recommend also searching or posting on r/AskFeminists as well about this, it's a common issue and you might get even more responses there.
2354.) You are not crazy.  You have just been conditioned by society to think this way.  Start asking yourself why and don’t stop until you can give yourself a good answer.  Also know that woman have all of the control when it comes to creating the world that they want for themselves.  It hasn’t always been this way, because men and women have fought to deny us the sexual selection that we harness.  Men, by force and women by oppression and conditioning have been deciding who we fuck and who’s babies we make.  If we want to change things all we have to do is decide to not have babies of men who harbor toxic masculinity.  It’s not as simple as it sounds, but the birds were able to do it.  Less than 5% of male birds have penis’. Because male birds could use it to force mate with females, bypassing their selection process, female birds chose over and over male birds with the smallest pieces to mate with and eventually they lost it.  They just have holes now that need to be aligned with the lady’s hole to inseminate.  And birds have the most elaborate and extensive courtship rituals in the animal kingdom with ladybird consent being ultimate.  So, in conclusion if we stop having misogynist’s babies and threaten the male population with keeping their penis’ we could end the patriarchy in a generation.  Evolution gave us the upper hand.  We just have to use it wisely!
2355.) I find it helpful to take a long perspective.  The women who marched and organized in the ninteenth century had more than just "can't vote" against them.  They couldn't own property.  They could be legally beaten and starved by their father or husband, and legally raped by their husband.  Their children belonged, in the property sense, to their husband, and they belongdd ro him too.    

They did not let all those hurdles stop them.  They didn't even change most of those things in their own lifetime.  They believed that if they could secure the right to vote, the rest would follow.  And they were right, eventually. Their daughters faught for divorce, and abortion, and the right to own their own property.  THEIR daughters faught for equal pay, and they are still fighting, and their daughters are fighting against harrassment and rape culture.  Those things were worth fighting for, are worth fighting for.  We know it's not hopeless, because we can see the progress already made.  

Sexual harassment was as natural as breathing to men and women in 1950.  Marital rape was not a phrase because it made no sense to think about.  Those things have changed in living memory.  If our mothers and grandmothers could get through those barriers, then how can we do less for our daughters?

2357.) It's funny how owning a gun is decriminalized but having an abortion is criminalized. This is appalling.
2358.) UPDATE: My package has sent! & I posted a photo of the confirmation with the following paragraph, tagging Mike DeWine on both Facebook and Instagram: 

Dear Governor Mike DeWine,
Enjoy your present to abort whatever blockage is in your behind! There will be many more coming to choose from! Thanks for sending women back decades of progress! This hanger is a symbol for what is to come with the passing of this bill. This bill excludes rape & incest pregnancies as well. This heartbeat bill is a clear unconstitutional violation of women’s universal rights to body autonomy. It not only violates the US’s Bill of Rights, but is unlawful under the Supreme Court landmark case Roe vs Wade. It is also a violation of the United Nation’s Sexual Health & Reproductive Rights statement that abortion is a human right. You’ve disregarded a woman’s universal rights & imposed your personal religious views on citizens with this law, another violation of the First Amendment. You have put the lives of Ohio women in danger. You have contributed to defunding Planned Parenthood, limiting our rights to access affordable contraceptives. The passing this bill will increase the “back alley” abortions we have fought so hard to end. Our uterus is not public domain. My body is not a public debate. If you want to lower abortion rates, allowing them is the answer. Creating easier access to contraceptives & instilling a progressive sexual health education programs would greatly lower unwanted pregnancies. This chain reaction of progress can be found in other countries all over the world. For example, Italy, Germany, & Sweden have these policies in place and have the lowest teenage abortions in Europe. I hope you reconsider your stance on this bill, but I know you won’t; you’ve already displayed your ignorance by passing it. We will fight for justice to get this overturned. We will continue to fight for women’s rights & our universal right to body autonomy. Roe vs. Wade shall never be overturned.

2367.) Just think your 15 or 16 year old daughter/son watched this video accidentally. I think we shouldn't actually involve in such cases cause we cannot do anything in here. We have really big issues to be solved. Please correct me if I'm wrong
2368.) Here in the uk we don’t have that system. Yes we have juries. 15 people are selected at random from a computer system. Those 15 people then go into court and out of the 15, 12 are selected at random. They then get to sit as a jury panel.
2369.) There is much that is disingenuous about this post, but I understand the spirit of it.
2370.) Weird, I served on a jury in a rape case. We were asked if we had any personal history that might cause us to be impartial, but we were allowed to go into the judge's chamber to talk with the judge privately. And it wasn't an automatic dismissal, there were a few women, myself included, that felt they would still be able to base their opinions on the evidence presented despite our personal histories.
2371.) From my understanding when selecting the jury. They will even dismiss people who have served in similar cases because they are looking for the least potential bias group. I don’t think they were trying to make an excuse for the abuser.
2372.) 1- that’s not how jury selection works.
2- served on a rape civil trial jury with men and women.
2373.) Maybe less men would assault women if the jury always consisted of women who understand the horrors of what the victim has gone through.

I'm just saying.
2374.) This is a terrifying read.
2375.) Burden of proof is problematic with sexual assault.  Persecution rates are horrible. We need to fix this.
2376.) Correct me if I’m wrong (and I probably am). But doesn’t this make a lot of sense. If you’ve been a victim of a crime you’re gonna have biases towards the person arrested.

In short: ME TOO IS TOO SMALL AND NEEDS TO BECOME US TOO!  Any momentum it has should not be wasted to fix our largest public health crisis, the source of the problems that me too is dealing with.
—————————————-

I got kinda irritated with its myopic perspective on an issue that is a crap ton bigger than it was being talked about and still hasn’t been adequately done with.

Long story short I was living at home after a job loss and for awhile paying off school loans when I suddenly got not only a brain and body reorganization where the universe opened up and I was euphoric for like a week and a half, but I also had every single planet in the universe connect and come together.

It was a cataclysmic wake up like, my brain I could feel if processing things quickly - recalculating 31 years worth of experience.
 
Then in my stomach and chest - something felt as if it shifted to the left and dropped into place and then had a thousand tendrils twist and integrate into my body. 

It was nuts. 

Well, if you didn’t grow up with boundries and you just woke up to all the hidden feelings in your body to find that both your parents are basically narcisistic. 

It dosent come with an instruction manual.  Especially a complete one that walks you through the story.

I was nice I was understanding and did my best 1000x over always having to work at trying to be the better person to see how I could get what ever progress to working through this.        Problem. Rejection is processed in the same area of the brain as physical pain.    So death by 1000 cuts to the point I cracked one night and felt like I hit a wall and felt like committing supervise suddenly. 
I was mindful but it felt like I hit the hardest wall ever. And I basically found my self in a hyperaroused state that just couldn’t calm down and it kept going to point every family member I went to just basically further invalidated me.   

I fell into a weird traumatized loop that was hard to get out of without help from the therapist I was talking to through Better help.

I was a ping pong ball though, that no one was putting down back on the table to rest.

The problem, the 2nd time I saw my sister, I tried talking to her and explaining how I felt, and basically I got told I’m the problem again.

And yet, some how 7 mins later what did I get a giant lecture on..... ME TOO!! Movement!!!!!

I respect what the movement worked/is working on. 

But to be honest that was not the time to talk to me about how we have to do things to stop these “powerful men” from abusing women in the work place.

Me too! Is a natural evolution of women in the work place, it’s essentially just a movement to renegotiate boundaries which is useful.

General x women it was. - if you don’t like it leave the room
Millennial women - we want to be in the room at the table, because if we leave the room, we can’t be at the table.        And with how women tend to on average have higher agreeableness,


Yet here is my problem, I’m sitting here dealing with symptoms of ptsd (there is a reason the body blunts those feelings growing up so this dosent happen)

Getting lectured about “powerful men”

When what I went to my sister about was power too, it dosent matter where it is, power is power, wheather it’s authoritative positional power or relational power in families.

It’s all power based on attatchments and tribes.

And it hits me during this lecture I got a couple of things.

1) it’s the narcisists that lead social movements. Not the npd ones per se, but def for sure the sub clinical ones.    Trust me, I have my sister lecturing me , and then got a cousin who leads a department at a major newspaper and reports and pushes me too often and helped break some of the stories on it.

I my self am a 7/10 where 5 is healthy on the spectrum went out and brought 2000 families into a character based program during my time working.

We are out there one way or another pushing movements, it’s the malignant ones you have to really watch out for.  Now I admit, we are a high performing narc family, but still a narc family.

Yet still, we can push me too all we want, but these issues willnever go away untill we fix the core issue. 

One that all the information is out on already including a data driven process to the prevention of childhood trauma and maltreatment.

https://www.annaageeight.org/
Anna age 8, the data driven plan towards the prevention of childhood trauma and maltreatment.


Every:
goverment
health
education
Civic/religious/ youth org

leaders all need to be asked one question...


”what’s the plan to prevent childhood trauma, which is at epidemic levels?”

and when they give you a blank stair get them and the other leaders to a table to take the Anna age 8 training and to start created an integrated plan to prevent these.

Get their contact info and their willingness to start talking It up, and contact them when a day has been set for the other leaders.


Childhood trauma’s devastating impact on health

“This is treatable. This is beatable. The single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say, ‘this is real, and this is all of us,’ ” she said.

[Watch Nadine Burke Harris’ TED talk: How childhood trauma affects health across a lifetime](https://www.ted.com/talks/nadine_burke_harris_how_childhood_trauma_affects_health_across_a_lifetime) 

[Harvard: childhood trauma impacts, article](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/childhood-traumas-devastating-impact-on-health/) 



Trauma of any type fixates is on our own experience, it’s a normal reaction and defense system behavior.

The problem, we have been so busy demonizing people which is easy and comfortable than to recognize this is literally ALL OF US!

That yes we need to erect proper boundaries, but when we don’t go any further and fix the CORE ISSUE at hand, then we miss the chance for real fundamental change.

So yes, how about an “US TOO” movement

Now I may be a guy,  and I’ve supported me too, it made sense wasn’t against it in any way. 

But it didn’t stir my soul, you want something that will, pick that core issue that is all of us, for waking up to this crap and realizing that having the chance to explain and piece together ever piece of my experience growing up in a way that couldn’t be refuted.  I may be getting some of my stuff together still, but if you don’t think I’m going after every mayor and superintendent I have in my phone located on the 3 Separate service areas I served prior to today.    Each areas was about 20 towns and total available youth ranged from 30,000 to 60,000 in each.

The problem - the trauma movement won’t take off on its own. It’s deliberate, knowing that for once we can make real change in this country that is so core to our existence that it will improve just about everything.

And it can use the support of me too.  Because sexual assault is just a piece of what I’m proposing we tackle.


I talked to someone who thought the issue could be fixed in 20 years, and I’m sorry, little Ethan an Anna don’t have that long to wait, because it needs to be fixed 10 mins ago. 

And unless we want this to be ignored for a 5 time in history, it’s a torch we all need to carry.
2396.) And ?
2397.) [removed]
2398.) All dresses should have pockets 2k19
2399.) My wife and sister noticed the other day that my 2mo nephew has real pockets in his pants. What does he need pockets for? Why are his real and theirs not?
2400.) I couldn't imagine this being controversial on a feminist sub, those tiny pockets/fake pockets are a very stupid kind of stupid.


*brother saw my screen and said "yes. I've always complained about that."
2401.) I have started only supporting pocket pants companies. PACT makes fair trade cotton leggings with full pockets that fit a phone (on BOTH sides) and they are awesome.
2402.) But where is the lie???
2403.) It’s a ploy from Bug Purse! They want us to spend money on bags!

(this is half sarcasm)
2404.) my new American Eagle Jean's have pockets that are big enough for my whole hand, fingers spread! and big back pockets too. its amazing. I went out without a purse! I'm super in love
2405.) He isn't wrong tbh.
2406.) Oh hell yea, those tiny pockets are bullshit
2407.) I'm sick of people saying it's our fault for buying pants with shitty pockets in the first place. Do they know how hard it can be to find pants that fit a non-standard body type AND have pockets AND don't cost an arm and a leg? Especially in a rural area where you have to travel an hour or more to get to one store that sells jeans, because buying pants online without being able to try them on is such a risk.
2408.) Haha my sister always gets mad at how all of the pockets on her pants are fake
2409.) Finally someone said it!
2410.) I can't imagine what it's like to wear jeans without pockets. I just buy my pants from the men's section.
2411.) Wha? Is that really something ppl should make signs for? Educate me.
2412.) What does this mean?
2413.) I only buy mans pants and pockets are one reason for that.   
When I needed some pants for the gym I spent a lot time finding some with pockets that fit my phone because I need music.
2414.) Mens suit also have tight pockets
2415.) [removed]
2416.) Or any pockets, not the BS fake pockets I wasted my money on once not knowing any better
2417.) He's right. A lot of you women are getting quite fat. Bigger pockets are definitely in order
2418.) [removed]
2419.) Women have to demand it. Companies respond to demand and right now a majority of women do not seem to want larger front pockets
2420.) Women don't spend 2hr 48min per day cooking.
2421.) Why does this matter
2422.) And this is relevant how?
2423.) This isn’t because of relevant sexism today, but it is due to the fact that in older generations women had less opportunities. Today it is actually flipping with female students have much higher acceptance rates into universities. This shows that in generations to come this could likely be reversed (while probably not as drastic as this source claims) because there won’t be as many stay-at-home moms (which for the record, mothers staying at home to take care of their children is expected because of maternal instincts). 

Either way it’s unfair to say this is sexism (and btw none of the women I know cook nearly this long).
2424.) [removed]
2425.) Stupid idea. Causes more deaths than abortion by itself!
2426.) That is a truly stupid idea, why would You ends someone’s life for making a choice, so many ignorant, unfair people.
2427.) Ha, if that happens, I can’t wait to see the back lash
2428.) ...
2429.) lol they're expressions are exactly the same 

Derpy lookin ass
2430.) She probably ran intellectual circles around them. POS
2431.) >As compensation for her year's service, she was paid one dollar. After only a year in office, she declined to seek reelection.

wtf, one dollar only???
2432.) This story should be made into a film.
2433.) jokes on them, she won
2434.) They must have thought of her the same way we think of towns that have a goat or something as the mayor. Disgusting.
2435.) just like modern times
2436.) Ah, fun times.
2437.) Ugh.
2438.) Very similar to the first woman senator in 1922. She was appointed in GA and was basically just a proxy for the governor  who was going to run in general election, so he didn’t have a real opponent.
2439.) Hope she at least did a good job.

And DIDNT go through any children’s book scandal like OUR mayor is going through....
2440.) From the article:

 

**It's fascinating to watch** the language of food consumption mutate as it travels across genders. For decades, "dieting" was the domain of women. It looked like Weight Watchers, it looked like Snackwells, it looked like South Beach, but whatever it looked like, it was always portrayed as something simultaneously necessary, shameful, pride-inducing, hated and ever-present.

The term became a victim of “gender contamination,” as Amanda Mull [wrote in the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/10/tech-industry-diet-products-have-whole-new-language/574390/)— which is “when a product or idea becomes so female-coded that men are no longer willing to engage with it.”

Instead men — and the companies that cater to them — found new ways to describe food restriction. Not “weight loss” but “performance-enhancing.” Not “look great” but “perform better.”

Not “count calories” but “disrupt calories.”

The most [provocative tweet](https://twitter.com/michellecyca/status/1115654588793675782) posted in response to Dorsey’s interview started to go viral:

> “Tech bros ‘discovering’ that anorexia makes you hyper-focused and euphoric is the dumbest trend of 2019.”

&#x200B;

I don’t know whether we’re moving forward or backward or just into the upside down. It’s both remarkable and depressing to watch Jack Dorsey blithely describe a diet that would put any woman — or any non-wealthy man — into the penalty box of public opinion.

It’s both thought-provoking and aggravating to think about how tech bros have managed to hijack the whole dieting concept. To move from “you’ll never guess how many calories are in just one of these,” to “the experience I had was when I was fasting for much longer, how time really slowed down,” as Dorsey said in his interview.

One wants to grab him by the hoodie strings and bellow, “that’s not mental clarity, my good man — that’s starvation.”

What’s most interesting is how this group acts as though they’re disrupting the way we consume food. They’re not disrupting the way we consume food. They’re just doing the same crap women have been working to stop doing for years.
2441.) [removed]
2442.) yeah, but men are more likely to get convicted. it can go both ways and it's not as simple as you're trying to make it out to be
2443.) But more likely to not need too
2444.) Women also get shorter sentences and are less offten convicted
2445.) When you’re paid 70% of what men make for the exact same job, that’s what ya get. It fucking sucks ass.
2446.) Leftist exbf thought he wasnt sexist but had an awful tendency of defending rapists and blaming women for their own assaults. My dad thinks he's a feminist but constantly says awful things about men who do even slightly feminine things like cook or bake and puts down everything remotely feminine in order to feel more masculine and it's just exhausting trying to explain why he's being misogynistic.
2447.) Most people aren't as liberal or left of center as they like to think they are. That goes for people of all genders.
2448.) Brocialists are a thing, unfortunately. IMO if you claim to be a feminist with male privileges you have to admit that you can't fully understand misogyny because of experiencing it first-hand and constantly try to better yourself with that in mind.
2449.) I do not believe at all in the goodness of the invisible hand. "Free markets" are not "good". Left alone things can end up hurting humanity. 

I therefore think that planning is important. 

My morality is based on Utilitarianism, that we should strive for the greatest benefit for all. All of us on the left are not good people. Nor all on the right bad. But I strongly believe in this meta goal.

I think this socialist/utilitarian approach is by nature femenist. We will not survive as a species without fully empowered women.
2450.) We are a only ever can be our concepts. It’s why we need to deliberetly build them.

People don’t realize that concepts are emotional as they are cognitive.
2451.) Can people stop conflating being left and right wing with being liberal and conservative (small c)/authoritarian. 

When you say you're left or right, you're talking about economics, eg. You believe in more state spending in social programs or less, big government vs. small government sort of thing.

Being liberal or conservative relates to your opinion on social issues, one can be left wing and conservative, just as one can be left wing and liberal. The same goes for the other way around.

The guy was probably left wing economically, but more conservative rather than liberal on the social issues front.
2452.) It’s not unconstitutional, it’s a step in the right direction.

2454.) I am a Christian Egaltarian and I approve this message. That sounds like a horrible book. I am so sick and tired of the lies of comp teachings. Wake up church! Jesus didn't promote oppression!
2455.) So this cosmic being created the almost incomprehensible vastness of the universe, and he's a dude who demands that people follow a rigid set of genitalia based laws. 

When you tolerate douchnozzle behavior by the funky smelling hairy backed dude you gave your virginity to on your wedding night, it is pleasing to this all powerful being. He has revealed this in ancient times to people who wiped their asses with their hands and wondered where the sun went at night.

As it is written in the new testament in phallacies3:16 God loved people so much that in all his divine revelations, he never bothered to just drop some actually useful knowledge like, "Hey asshole. I created this shit called bacteria. All your kids died because you wipe your asses with your hands and then get it everywhere. Cut that shit out yo. It's fukin gross"
2456.) Could someone please elaborate the meaning of awrah?
2457.) “Islamic version considers the voice of a woman awrah” is a stretch. Fundamentalist/wahhabist Islam is not the inherent version of Islam.
(Source: a secular feminist Muslim woman)
2458.) Islam is oppressive to women, whether a woman practicing it acknowledges it or not
2459.) I saw this image unedited on the news a couple days ago and found it VERY powerful. good post.
2460.) I love this version. It looks like she is even more powerful. Hopefully this is the beginning of a change.
2461.) There should be more of these posts on this sub. The fact that most of these posts are on the western world is very discriminating to woman in the middle east who are truly oppressed and don't have a voice.

White middle/upper-class women, in the western world are one of the most privileged groups in the world, I would say second only to white middle/upper-class men.
2462.) [removed]
2463.) Shocking... /s
2464.) Universities in the UK are getting filthy rich now on fees, there is no excuse at all for not focusing on reduction of sexual assault.
2465.) Again its not that simple, undoubtedly there are more sexual assaults in uni's, on both men and women, than what the statistics say. Most of the time it's their word against someone else and that by its self is not going to get the rapist, if they did do it (that's another problem, potential fake claims), jailed. you need more evidence, so I think the way to solve this issue is with educational and legal change. I don't know what legal/educational change that is, maybe harsher jail time, bigger fines, more councillors etc.

And finally, many people make their judgement instantly that the person is instantly guilty so just remember innocent before proven guilty.
2466.) Rape isnt as big of a problem as liberal media makes it out. Think for yourselves, don't be the sheep cnn and abc and nbc prey on.
2467.) Some people are confusing interest in her work with erasing the entire team that worked on the project. Does anyone think it would be inflammatory at all, if a man had written the program algorithm and was featured in much of the news? But because she's a woman, we have people upset that others are praising a woman's scientific accomplishment. 

"I just think *everyone* who worked in it should be featured."

 *Posts a 500 person photo in which you can barely make out anyone's face, while people say Katie doesn't deserve any attention in the comments and generally trash her because she didn't do the work of 500 people entirely herself*
2468.) > *The effort wouldn't have been possible without Katie Bouman, who developed a crucial algorithm that helped devise imaging methods.  Three years ago, Bouman led the creation of an algorithm that eventually helped capture this first-of-its-kind image: a supermassive black hole and its shadow at the center of a galaxy known as M87. She was then a graduate student in computer science and artificial intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.*  
>  
> *Bouman starts teaching as an assistant professor at California Institute of Technology in the fall.*
2469.) Pretty sure she is not a grad student, but actually an assistant professor now.
2470.) I love how happy and excited she looks in this picture. Well deserved that her name is out there.
2471.) I don't mean to diminish her contribution, but in these sorts of enormous collaborations putting all the focus on one person is pretty ridiculous. Here is the list of everyone who contributed to this part of the project.

2472.) Meanwhile my news feed has been flooded with photos of Andrew Chael, with titles like "This is the man who's really responsible for the photo of the black hole." They just really can't handle the fact that a woman is getting credit for this. 

If it were the opposite scenario -- with Katie "writing all the code" and Andrew "leading the project," would you expect 90% of Redditors to rush to Katie's defense and make sure she gets credit? No. There'd be a few threads in /r/feminism type subreddits and that would be it.
2473.) Thanks, grad student!
2474.) Lots of people made it possible, she contributed alot of course but so did alot of other people. A massive team of over 200+

She even said ' "No one of us could've done it alone,". "It came together because of lots of different people from many different backgrounds."
2475.) Bravo Katie!
2476.) [deleted]
2477.) That was one of the biggest discoveries in probably all of human history
2478.) Don't just thank her though, thank everyone involved, both men and women. It's stupid and disrespectful to the rest of the team to say it was just her work that made it possible for the image.

2483.) I have deleted my other comment as many people have worked on this project, and all team members had a hand in this. My facts did not have a primary source and I don’t want to go around spreading lies. All I’m saying is that everyone should be credited, instead of posts saying that she is single-handedly responsible for this. She told us herself that it was a team effort.

2487.) A true hero but Im wondering if her name will be just as remembered as Steven Hawking's or Einstein's
2488.) It's 2019. Voting wont happen until 2020. So any poll that comes out a year before the election even starts is going to be wrong. Also it's been white male presidential candidates on both political parties for a while. I don't see Why race and gender have to do with who to vote for. I will vote for who I think will be a strong leader regardless of gender or race.
2489.) Who fucking cares?
2490.) [removed]
2491.) I definitely feel this, unfortunately. I also dislike how sex positive feminism has made it impossible to talk about the negatives of sex work. Before you down vote me, let me make it clear that if you are genuinely not hurt by sex work and find it enjoyable, more power to you. But this should not invalidate the experiences of women who have been hurt by this industry. Not everyone chooses to do sex work or enjoys it, and it is important as feminists that we uplift and support women of all occupations.
2492.) Yeah.  I've seen this.  Hopefully, it's just a case of "some people will bully others about anything", but I wonder if it's not a general problem with how the US talks about sex.
2493.) also i’ve found that sex positivity has encouraged young women and girls to allow themselves to be objectified as if it’s empowering, and straight men have definitely taken this and ran with it. I can’t tell you how many guys when rejected sexually by me said something along the lines of “i thought you were like a modern empowered woman!!” lol. I also had a guy who i had a brief casual but very intense relationship with come back into my life looking to hook up again, and when i told him no because I didn’t want to get hurt he was all “but aren’t you all empowered and sex positive, why can’t you separate sex from emotions??” um, because sex and emotions are biologically linked for species survival and no amount of feminism can undo that??
2494.) I agree completely. I'm relatively "kinky" and embrace it. However, I've also seen my girl friends deal with a lot of shaming because they don't like the stuff society now believes they should. Ex: one of my friends constantly shares these edgy memes about being choked during sex. One of her friends commented something along the lines of "cool, but not for me" and was shamed for it. It's odd.
2495.) Yes, absolutely. I see this with sex work, too. Something like 80% of women in the industry want out, but we ignore them for the 20% who don't. The sentiment is positive— let women do what they want with their bodies, but sometimes it goes too far.
2496.) Yes! I actually had a situation today where I was accused of being a prude and not supporting women because I asked my coworker to stop discussing the details of her sex life at work. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it tbh.
2497.) Yep. I’m very sex positive, extremely so, but this is how I’ve always been since I discovered my own body sexually. I have, however, noticed a lot of friends that are ultra competitive try to out-kink others when I know for a fact they aren’t normally into a lot of those sex acts or situations.

An example I have would be a friend from childhood. She’s a very competitive person and suffers from FOMO a lot. She’s made out with other women only to regret it or turn around and insist she’s not really bi or even remotely bi-curious. She just doesn’t want to look lame or vanilla compared to a lot of her friends. She’s also agreed to have threesomes with her current and previous partners when you can tell she’s highly uncomfortable with it, but she feels like she’s not the cool girlfriend if she isn’t down.

I do think sex positivity is a part of it, but I also think a lot of it is due to unhealthy comparisons and competitive behavior. A lot of women see sex positive women as being put up on a pedestal (majorly by men) or being referred to as “the dream” and then naturally want to achieve that status as well. And the ones who have healthy personal boundaries know better than to engage, but still get left feeling like less-so. It’s not right :/ and I’m not sure how to solve it. I don’t think telling other women to tone down their otherwise healthy sexual urges is the solution, though.
2498.) It's rough.

When I actually ended up having to read Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon's works I thought I'd dislike them, but it turned out that I felt like they were definitely right on a lot of points.

Within the second wave, there were a lot of fairly sex-negative feminists partly in response to the "sexual revolution." I mean, the sexual revolution had the potential to really liberate women's sexuality, especially in how the pill gave women an option for birth control that didn't rely on the cooperation of male sexual partners. 

But it also came in a time and context where those advances could easily be caged back in by patriarchal thinking. Attempts to control women's sexuality went from largely coming from one angle ("no sex outside of marriage! You must be a virgin for your husband so he can know his children are his!") to becoming a wildly confusing two-pronged approach that now included "since you're now sexually liberated, you must stay sexually available for men."

At least when things were wildly repressive before the expectations were clear, but in the interim between the earlier stage of the sexual revolution and continuing to today, we still have to deal with bullshit like the thought that someone should be "a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets." In other words, that women should somehow be expected to meet two completely contrasting ideals that both leave women themselves with little to no agency over their sexuality.

Unfortunately, I feel like MacKinnon + Dworkin made a huge error in pushing for the anti-pornography ordinance since it lead them to ally with staunchly conservative groups that were all too eager to "agree" on one issue while being absolutely horridly anti-feminist for far too many others.

The same issues carry on to today, unfortunately.

For example, for sex work, there are all too many clients who are not at all concerned whether the sex work they're involved with is remotely ethical. Like, ethical sex work, in which sex workers take home the lion's share of the profits from their own sex work, can be a good and empowering thing even though it's taking place within the context of a patriarchal and capitalist society that's happy for sex to be transactional. One of my friends who got into sex work straight up blew me away with her professionalism (I wish I could organize my life nearly as well as she organized clients and taking precautions to stay safe).

But just because she is able to ethically engage in and benefit from the industry doesn't mean that most people are. All too often, there is someone else who disproportionately benefits from someone else's body (whether in commercial porn, which all too often treats actresses as disposable, underpaid commodities for how much money their effort will earn the company, or with prostitution, where a bad pimp or madam takes home most of the money someone else earned).
2499.) I haven’t encountered this thankfully, but shaming someone for having “vanilla” sex is the opposite of being sex-positive.

We need to make a better effort in not calling things that aren’t feminism, feminism. It’s the reason the movement gets such a bad rep.
2500.) A few years ago I was involved in the local kink community, and was often meant to feel "less than" for being/wanting monogamy. Ugh.
2501.) I am friends with many open couples and when they’ve talked about stuff where I had no input, and I didn’t input, they acted as though I were being rude. 

Look, dude, not everyone is into being tied up, Susan, you do you, but I don’t care about your rope class!
2502.) I think it's sad that the whole discussion about sex negativity got so entangled with radical feminism (TERFs) that we are almost afraid of talking about it. Sex can and is used to pressure women and I know a lot of women who had sexual experiences before they felt ready because of the pressure to "not be a prude". It's really two sides of the same coin and we got stuck only talking about sex positivity because no one sane wants to be mistaken for a TERF.
2503.) I have actually never seen vanilla used as an insult, that's pretty shocking to me that someone would do that. The kink community is usually really huge on acceptance and understanding of any consensual sex related activity between adults. 

If anyone is trying to shame someone into having a certain intimate experience (kink isn't inherently sex, though it can easily revolve around or lead to sex) that's never remotely appropriate or acceptable. 

I haven't seen what you're describing but that's messed up wherever it is happening.
2504.) Vanilla is one of my favourite flavours. Love a good vanilla cupcake especially when it’s made with real vanilla pods. My fave candle is vanilla scented. I feel a bit judged every time! But I don’t care, if I’m basic then I’m basic, I love vanilla.
2505.) I'm sorry you've had that experience. Is it possible you've fallen in with a group of unusually unpleasant people? My spouse and I are pretty "vanilla," and get no grief at all about it even from friends who are themselves not vanilla in the slightest.
2506.) As an asexual woman, I couldn't agree more. I'm all for sex positivity and against slutshaming, but as I don't feel sexual attraction, it made me feel like I was a "bad feminist" for some time
2507.) I understand where you're coming from and have heard things like this before, but I think this is almost a "too much of a good thing" situation if that makes sense. Women are finally feeling comfortable enough to talk about their kinks and be sexual creatures, so it's not totally surprising that some people would take it too far by accidentally or intentionally shaming others for not being into the same things.  This is definitely a problem because no one should ever be shamed, but after decades of women's sexualities being suppressed, I think this is a negative symptom of something generally positive.
2508.) IME, "sex positive feminism" means have sex all the time with everybody. And while you are at it, film it and post it online. Have some guys jerk off to it and post that. Sex positive!  


I'm exaggerating to make a point but not by much.
2509.) I definitely do believe sex groups can be like that. Like other groups, kink circles can be highly toxic. I'm in highly sex positive groups and some people can just shame people who are interested/not interested in different stuff. This seems to be a problem in the overal sexual minority community. People can attack other people for being interested in different stuff.
2510.) That's not my feminism. I know that sounds stupid, but it's the same shit I've been hearing since I was 15 and pressured into sex because I was being called a prude and told I'd be broken up with if I didn't (by a friend regarding what the bf had said). I recently got in a fight with a friend because she sneered that a different girl was a prude. Why does that have to be a bad thing? 

Shaming people for too much or too little sex, too kinky or too vanilla... Just stay the hell out of everyone else's sex lives and stop being assholes. I already hear the whore/prude bullshit from men, I don't need it from women too. It's worse coming from women, as well. So shitty all around.
2511.) I recently watched an interview of Rashida Jones, who has worked with women involved in amateur porn. She talks about how pop culture has normalised the sexualisation of everything. She very pertinently points out the difference between sexuality and sexualization.
And to an extent, I agree with her, with twerking become a norm, you need to go above and beyond that to establish yourself in the music/movie industry. Therefore, more and more kinky/sexual stuff becomes the benchmark with which everything is compared to. 

She also points out that while sex positivism is a good thing at the same time it is very limiting. A lot of celebrities capitalise on their sexuality (as sex does sell) & it limits you to go beyond that in real life. A celebrity who is sexualised (be it Britney Spears or Justin Beiber) will find themselves compartmentalised in that cliche. Not just celebrities, but even in your daily day-to-day mundane life, everyone is expected to always look sexy/sexual. A daily commodification of people.

2512.) I feel this as well. I feel like as a woman in heterosexual sexual relationships I’m made to feel as though I need to have a level of sexual openness that is not always easy. Like I’m expected to the moment sex is on the table lay down my needs and make sure the guy is down for them. What if I just want to be a giver? Then I’m made to feel shame because I’m perpetuating a stereotype. I just want to unpoliticize sex and make it something more personal again.
2513.) Yup, I have a lot of trauma related reservations regarding my own sexuality and expressing it and I feel like i have no space to set that boundary in some circles cause we're supposed to be fully open in these conversations at all times
2514.) It's funny cause in my feminist group it's actually the opposite? I'm always like "plz no kinkshame"... They say stuff about how liking it rough is fucked up, and a result of porn brainwashing. How loving to slap women in bed is terrible and a mirror of everyday violence...   
So I don't really understand where you're coming from with this, I have such a different perception of it.
2515.) I also think that people in these circles are telling girls far too young that being sexual is good and you SHOULD do it. not saying it isn't or anything, but this message is being applied to everyone when it shouldn't be told to 14 year old girls and such.
2516.) As a homoromantic asexual, I really appreciate this post.
2517.) In kink circles, I've never heard the term "vanilla" used in a derogatory way, only in a way that means, "they're not interested in kink."

Where do you see it being thrown around?
2518.) shaming people for being vanilla is gross imo.

another thing I don't like is people online taking other people's boundaries as an attack or repression.  like people who horny post all the time being asked to hide posts from me or content warning stuff getting mad at me for that.
2519.) this just sounds like a failure to be truly sex positive more than anything else
2520.) I agree wholeheartedly. I like that the stigma around sex is slowly being removed but I often feel like it is becoming too much.
2521.) One of the greatest internal issues of feminism is the fact that some feminists think that feminism should be about choice and equality (i.e. you can absolutely be a rocket scientist, brain surgeon or athlete but, if you want to be a stay-at-home mum that's cool- as long as its what makes you fulfilled and happy), whereas other feminists have a list of what is 'permissible' and a list of what is 'unpermissible' in a 'good' feminist.  


Personally, if I wanted someone telling me how I 'should' behave, what I 'could' do and what was 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable', I'd not be a feminist!
2522.) I know what you mean, and as a vanilla person, I used to feel awkward around my more sexually adventurous friends. But I don't know if that was me being uncomfortable and feeling ashamed, or if it was them being uncomfortable and trying to act like they were "right" about sex. 

When I was younger my very vocal girlfriends basically convinced me that sex was awesome and I should have it often and freely. I wanted to be cool and sex was something the women I thought were cool had a lot of. I thought I was doing it wrong since I was not orgasming, not enjoying any kink, getting emotionally attached to sexual partners, feeling bad about myself for sleeping with a lot of people. But my friends said it was fun so, dammit, I kept trying! It really wasn't for me. After having ridiculously amazing sex (albeit vanilla) within committed relationships, I'm really comfortable with my relationship to sex and the lessons I learned from my attempts to be adventurous. 

Now that I'm older, I've noticed that sex talk among friends is truly more positive than it used to be. My ladies are comfortable with their sex lives. Some are in closed relationships, some in open or poly relationships, others are single and have lots of sex, others have no sex at all and are thrilled. Anyway, we are all more interested in relating and connecting honestly about the pros and cons of sex. I think when we were younger, we were trying so hard to fight against ideas of sexual oppression that our sex positivity was framed in a prescriptive way for others as well as ourselves ("You should like sex! You should like all the sex! Your discomfort is prudishness."). Now it's just fine for you to do you, whatever that means, so long as you aren't hurting anyone including yourself.

Oh! And my girlfriends who are more into bdsm play have always been super mature and supportive about each person only doing things that they enjoy. But that seems to come out of an acceptance and comfort with their own sexual selves.
2523.) Do whatever feels comfortable for you. Whether that's not having sex at all or fucking the entire neighborhood on Super Bowl Sunday (I mean, a guy in Philly literally ate horse shit off the street in celebration when the Eagles won last year, weirder things have happened that day). Just as long as you're safe, honest and respectful about it so you don't hurt your or your partner's feelings. That's what a sex positive society should be.
2524.) I think women need to grab the bull by the horns. The world is changing and women need to be the beacons of hope as well as work like hell to save the planet. We can do it!  Women and men are closer to equality than we've probably ever been. It's time to rise and shine like the dawn that we are! 

So, I think sex in general needs to be put in its place. Which is, not dealing with the patriarchy's bullshit agenda to subjugate women. 

I agree that being "normal" in bed may seem boring to some, however, there is much to be said for a natural amount of intimacy.
2525.) Yes! I feel this all the time. I think it comes out of the ideology of 2nd wave feminism. Before there was a pressure to ‘say no’ to sex, and there was (and still are) the push and resist dynamics between men and women. Nowadays theres a pressure to ‘say yes’. Second wave feminism tried to argue that women’s sexualities were oppressed and men’s sexuality was the ‘right way’ which in itself is androcentrism and i mean second wave fem has its own problems with intersectionality BUT........
2526.) I think this falls along the lines of feminists shitting on women who consciously choose to take on more traditional roles (domestic), wear religious garments that promote modesty, etc...

It's not your life. It's hers. Being a feminist means giving her (and every other human on the planet) the agency to express and pursue the life and identity she/he/ze/they choose.
2527.) I don’t like any sort of feminism that allows men to call women degrading names, beat them, or control them. That’s not good for anyone.
2528.) Overly sex positive activism is just as bad as sex negative in my opinion. In both circles you end up with the problem of purity spirals and a sort of clique-y-ness about things. What's wrong with being sex neutral, and leaving what consenting adults do with each other behind closed doors.
2529.) Can someone please define what is 'sex positive feminism'? Or is it literally just as it sounds.
2530.) [removed]
2531.) I love vanilla in all its forms, great smell, great ice cream, and missionary is the best position!
2532.) Tbh it seems like it comes from our response to shame the normal. I like to embrace my weirdness and "abnormality" as much as the next person, but shaming people for being "normal" is going too far
2533.) I think most people already accept that different things work for different people. My impression has been that this is also a huge point for the sex positive movement - do what you like and don't do what you don't like and it's nobody's business.
2534.) Your opinion is irrelevant, you're fucking stupid. Activism is what will bring this country down.
2535.) Today at work I listened as my female coworker told me that although harsh, she was okay with the bill. I was floored. I kept my mouth shut the entire time and just nodded and said shit like, "yeah, that's your opinion... okay yeah I could see that" while seething on the inside at her hypocritical selfishness and shortsightedness. 

She brought up about how it was hard for her to get pregnant (okay AND?? so everyone else should be punished for your individual experience???), and about how that baby didn't have a choice, that if you choose to have sex... yada yada. But she was okay with making a medical distinction. WHAT. THE. FUCK. I just couldn't even. I let that one go because I needed to focus on work and don't talk about my personal (radical!) beliefs like that often, much less at work. I am still really bothered by it. I seriously want nothing to do with her after today. Luckily my desk is moving soon. I just don't have respect for someone like that.

Oh and she talked about how she wishes people just would stop fighting for rights LOL, like everyone's rights, "just focus on loving each other". I mean, where do you even start a conversation with someone like that? I truly, truly, do not even get it. And we work in a progressive field!!!!!
2536.) Damn thats a lot of data.
2537.) A meme account I follow on Instagram posted this and so many of the comments were like “there were over 200 people on this team, it wasn’t just this woman.” 

If this was a photo of men next to this data all of the comments would just be like “wow cool that’s crazy” no one would say “it wasn’t just this man, there was a team of over 200 of them!” 

The rest of the comments were something along the lines of “why is this data in the kitchen?” And “wow these women will make great wives” 

But please , continue to tell me we don’t need feminism in 2019..
2538.) Yes, but how is this feminism?

Trust me both of them did amazing things, but

1.) Neither of them wanted all of this credit so it is slightly disrespectful
2.) Neither of them pulled all the weight for these accomplishments, granted they did a lot, but for media to give these two people all this recognition is unfair to the rest of the team, male or female.

from the article:

Heard adds that after r[eporting Depp’s abuse](https://pagesix.com/2018/10/03/johnny-depp-denies-amber-heard-abuse-allegations/), and following their divorce in January 2017, some people have claimed she faked her injuries. “Many people called me a liar (without ever hearing my story). I was dropped from a global fashion brand’s upcoming campaign. I lost a part for a movie in which I had already been cast. People I have never met or spoken to threatened me with violence. I received so many death threats I had to change my phone number on a near-weekly basis.

“People accused me of having abused Johnny. That simply is not true. I never attacked Johnny other than in self-defense (and in defense of my little sister). I have never physically abused anyone. I know what that does to people.”

She adds, “Instead, I have attempted to promote good in the world and to advocate an end to domestic violence. I have sought to use my public persona to speak out on an issue that was extremely meaningful to me and millions of other women and men every year. I have spoken out about violence in public, but I have always avoided specifically referencing Johnny, or recounting his violence against me, not only because I wanted to move past that phase of my life but also because I was constrained by the terms of a strict confidentiality agreement that Johnny had insisted upon as part of our divorce settlement.”
2543.) I’m currently reading How to Come Alive Again by Beth McColl (you may recognise her from her hilarious twitter).
2544.) Daring Greatly by Brené Brown.
2545.) I wish the publicity from this wasn't so dangerous for her.
2546.) So sad that there’s places in the world where women are treated like this. Heartbreaking
2547.) I hope she's able to get her message out and stay safe.
2548.) I really want to know what she is saying. I asked in Instagram but i guess no one speaks English.
2549.) She's an absolute hero for doing this and I'm so glad this is going viral. I wish all the best to her and our brothers and sisters in Sudan who have to fight this oppression.
2550.) So badass.
2551.) I wanted to actually contribute to your thread before saying you don't need to specify "women and women-identified" cause they're not different things, but the only feminist themed party games I could think of would be super nerdy, like instead of guessing who people are from baby pictures, guessing authors/books with the titles hidden which felt like something people wouldn't enjoy at all.
2552.) I dunno, seems like your family is right about what the Bible says. If that's a problem for you maybe you should quit the church entirely.
2553.) https://juniaproject.com/case-women-pastors-new-testament/

Thought the link might help. If I were you, I would point out to my family that the verse and chapter numbers weren't added until the middle ages. So taking one verse and deciding how to run a church is stupid.

Paul writes positively about women prophets and speaking tongues. (Although he does want everyone to be orderly). In his letters he greets important female church members.

2555.) Don't go to church. Any church. All churches and all religious people are evil and never to be trusted. Churches and religion have been tools for men to oppress women for ever.

Even if you do go to this new church, it will only be a matter of time before you see that they are just as prejudiced and hypocritical as they are anywhere else.
2556.) It sounds like the root cause of all of your issues is the Bible. As sick as your family's interpretation of scriptures is, it's the *correct* interpretation. That book is not for thoughtful people or feminists. 

It sounds like you've already recognized that your ethics conflict with your religion. You should just throw one of them out.
2557.) Timothy wasn't even actually written by Paul. It references political events which took place a
